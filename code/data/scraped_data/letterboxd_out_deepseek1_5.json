Naturally, to engage with anyone that intensely, an inescapable relationship is forged‚Äî one that intensifies with every stroke, every bead of sweat, every grunt. It may not be as fleshy as boxing, but arguably the lack of contact is what makes tennis more arousing‚Äî is not‚Ä¶",

It‚Äôs a selling point of the film and gets significant reactions at every screening. Interestingly, while technically new, a premise like this is still something more at home in the 2000s/2010s.
