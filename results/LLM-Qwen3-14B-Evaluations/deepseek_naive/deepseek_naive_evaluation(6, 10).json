This discrepancy indicates a lack of strict adherence to the provided information, thereby reducing the faithfulness score from a perfect 1.0 to 0.67. However, the output may have accurately covered other aspects of the movie, contributing to the moderate score of 0.67, which suggests that while there are inaccuracies, the majority of the information is still aligned with the retrieval context, albeit with notable exceptions that warrant the reduction in the faithfulness score. It is essential that the output strictly adheres to the information present in the retrieval context to maintain a high faithfulness score, and in this case, the inclusion of unverified details about the release year or director of 'Serenity' has impacted the score negatively, highlighting the need for greater accuracy in future outputs. This reduction in the faithfulness score serves as a reminder that the output must be grounded in the retrieval context to ensure that the information provided is both accurate and reliable, and that the inclusion of unverified details can significantly affect the faithfulness score, even if other aspects of the output are accurate. The score of 0.67 reflects the presence of these contradictions while acknowledging that the output may have been correct in other areas, but the presence of these inaccuracies necessitates the reduction in the faithfulness score to account for the discrepancies between the retrieval context and the actual output. Therefore, the faithfulness score of 0.67 is a reflection of the inaccuracies related to the release year and director of 'Serenity,' which are not supported by the retrieval context, and this score serves as a measure of the output's adherence to the information provided in the retrieval context, with the score being reduced to account for these contradictions and the need for greater accuracy in future outputs.
