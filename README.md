# Natural language processing course: Conversational Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Develop a conversational agent that enhances the quality and accuracy of its responses by dynamically retrieving and integrating relevant external documents from the web. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, this system will perform real-time information retrieval, ensuring up-to-date answers. Potential applications include customer support, academic research assistance, and general knowledge queries. The project will involve natural language processing (NLP), web scraping, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to optimize answer quality.
