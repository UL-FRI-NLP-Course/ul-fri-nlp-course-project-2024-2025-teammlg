Both films center on a taciturn protagonist with a particular set of skills, operating in the criminal underworld.\n\n8. Drive Angry (2011)\n\n    Director: Patrick Lussier\n\n    Cast: Nicolas Cage, Amber Heard, William Fichtner\n\n    Why Similar: While more of a supernatural action thriller, Drive Angry has a similar 'driving' motif and features a tough protagonist on a mission of vengeance. It\u2019s more over-the-top compared to Drive, but still shares some action-driven sensibilities.\n\n9. The Neon Demon (2016)\n\n    Director: Nicolas Winding Refn\n\n    Cast: Elle Fanning, Keanu Reeves, Christina Hendricks\n\n    Why Similar: Another visually stylized film from Refn, The Neon Demon shares Drive\u2019s lush, neon-heavy aesthetic and slow, hypnotic pacing. The film is about the dark side of the modeling industry, with surreal elements, psychological depth, and atmospheric tension.\n\n10. A Most Violent Year (2014)\n\n    Director: J.C. Chandor\n\n    Cast: Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain\n\n    Why Similar: A Most Violent Year shares Drive\u2019s focus on a morally conflicted character, set against the backdrop of a corrupt, crime-riddled world. The protagonist, played by Oscar Isaac, is a businessman trying to maintain his ethics in a world of violence and deceit."
