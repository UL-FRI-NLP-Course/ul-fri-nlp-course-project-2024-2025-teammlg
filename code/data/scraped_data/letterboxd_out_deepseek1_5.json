            "Reality and fantasy are equally shitty except in one of them you are important.",
            "There\u2019s a strong argument to be made for TOTAL RECALL as the greatest practical effects movie in history.",
            "For about 10 years Verhoeven was the undefeated God of being hired to turn in a crass piece of studio genre product\u2014in this case, a conspiratorial sci-fi thriller starring an A-list action star\u2014and both deliver on all the well-crafted, gruesomely entertaining memory/identity thriller setpieces (including some of the all-time great squib work, never forget that commuter escalator human shield lol) and smuggle in some genuinely intelligent satirical, subversive ideas. In this case, ones that make you consider who crafts the\u2026",
            "when cohaagen says ill blow this whole thing up &amp; be home in time for cornflakes does this mean he cant eat corn flakes whenever i know its breakfast food but hes rich its not like youre only allowed to eat corn flakes at specific times im broke as fuck and can make it \"time for cornflakes\" whenever i want",
            "\"See you at the party, Richter!\"For those of you who haven't seen this film, I have only one thing to say; \"Get your ass to Mars!\"",
            "okay psychotic but funreally loving and appreciating Michael Ironside as the emotional core of Verhoeven sci-fi. He\u2019s always so good \u00a0\u00a0everyone is like working hard which I appreciatedShout out to lil miss 3 titty bitch as well. It\u2019s crazy that I knew who she was for so many years, she was stuff of lore, really. Then she became real to me.\u00a0Movies are magic.\u00a0The last great practical effect was making a girl have 3 titties.\u00a0I\u2026",
            "Imagine a colonial power keeping a population of underpaid immigrant workers in poverty, exploiting their labor in order to plunder natural resources for personal gain. Lol, what will those wacky sci-fi writers think of next!?",
            "*Was a 95, now a 100*Watching Michael Ironside's arms getting torn off while Arnold exclaims, \"see you at the party, Richter!\", was a transcendent moment for ten year old me. Verhoeven is still the man. What a spectacle, thanks to Rob Bottin and team. Such a dazzling odyssey of shootouts and questions of identity. Layers of dreams and realities, often intertwined with social struggles. A single man controls the air supply, of course they can control your life. Just as prescient as ever.",
            "lmao when Arnold is drilling",
            "I didn\u2019t expect to love this as much as I do. After the predator movies made me mad I decided I want more Arnold so I watched this. It was sickGood:\u00a0- Practical effects are insane\u00a0- Story is gripping and has genuinely exciting twists- Arnold being cute and silly\u00a0Bad:- Girl character is lame- Actually most people who aren\u2019t Arnold are lame",
            "i love films that pretend that arnold is your regular average joe despite appearing twice the size of most humans",
            "hollywood needs to bring back animatronics that look like disgusting wet garbage pail kids."
