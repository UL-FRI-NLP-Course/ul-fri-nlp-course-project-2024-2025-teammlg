                "The actual output contains factual errors such as listing 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' as a 2006 film directed by Alan Moore, contradicting the expected output's 2016 date and correct director. It also omits many key films from the 1950s to 2000s, including 'Superman and the Mole Men' and 'Superman Returns', and notable animated films. Some details like director names and release years are incorrect or missing, reducing accuracy."
