                "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context contains no relevant information to support any of the sentences in the expected output, as the context is empty and provides no nodes for reference. The lack of any supportive or unsupportive reasons indicates that the expected output cannot be validated against the retrieval context at all, resulting in a complete mismatch and a contextual recall score of zero. The retrieval context being entirely empty prevents any possible alignment with the expected output, leading to the lowest possible score of 0.00, as there are no nodes in the retrieval context to reference for validation or contradiction of the expected output sentences. This absence of information renders it impossible to determine the correctness of the expected output, hence the score remains at 0.00. The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, and thus, no sentences from the expected output can be attributed to any node in the retrieval context, resulting in no supportive or unsupportive reasons being generated. The score is 0.00 due to the complete absence of any nodes in the retrieval context, which makes it impossible to validate the expected output, leading to a total contextual recall score of zero. The retrieval context being empty means there are no nodes to reference, making it impossible to attribute any part of the expected output to the context, hence the score is 0.00. The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is entirely empty and provides no nodes for the expected output sentences to be validated against, resulting in a complete mismatch and no possibility of generating supportive or unsupportive reasons. The score is 0.00 as the retrieval context is empty, meaning there are no nodes in the retrieval context to which any of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed, leading to no supportive or unsupportive reasons and a total contextual recall score of zero. The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context contains no nodes, making it impossible to validate or contradict any part of the expected output, resulting in a complete lack of contextual recall.
