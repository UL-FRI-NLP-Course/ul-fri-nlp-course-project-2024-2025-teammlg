                "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant, as each node's reason explicitly states that the retrieval context is empty and contains no information about the film Conclave's box office performance. None of the nodes provide any relevant data, and since they are all ranked equally with no relevant nodes appearing before irrelevant ones, the contextual precision score remains at 0.00. The first node, which is the only node provided, is irrelevant due to the absence of any information related to the query about the film's box office performance, leading to a complete failure in retrieving relevant information for the question asked. The repeated emphasis on the context being empty across all nodes underscores the lack of any useful information to support the expected output about the film's financial performance, resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00. The retrieval contexts do not contain any relevant nodes to address the input query, hence the score cannot be higher than 0.00. The reason provided in the retrieval context explicitly states that the context is empty, which directly explains the absence of relevant information needed to answer the question about the film's box office performance. The repeated mention of the empty context in the reason field of the retrieval context further confirms that no relevant information is present, thus the score cannot be improved despite the ranking order, as there are no relevant nodes to prioritize. The contextual precision score is 0.00 because all retrieval contexts are empty and contain no relevant information about the film Conclave's box office performance, leading to no relevant nodes being ranked higher than irrelevant ones. The first node's reason explicitly states that the retrieval context is empty, which directly correlates with the inability to provide any relevant information about the film's box office performance, resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00. The score is 0.00 because the retrieval contexts are entirely empty and do not contain any information relevant to the query about the film Conclave's box office performance, as clearly stated in the reason provided for the first node. The absence of any relevant information in the retrieval contexts prevents the contextual precision score from being higher than 0.00, as there are no relevant nodes to rank above the irrelevant ones. The score is 0.00 because the retrieval contexts are empty and contain no information about the film Conclave's box office performance, as explicitly stated in the reason provided for the first node, which is the only node available.

The score is 0.00 because the only node in the retrieval contexts is irrelevant as it is empty and contains no information about movies or their rankings, which is why it cannot contribute to answering the question about the top 10 movies of all time. The node's reason explicitly states this irrelevance, and since there are no relevant nodes ranked higher, the contextual precision remains at 0.00. The input requires information about movie rankings, but the retrieval context fails to provide any such data, resulting in a complete lack of relevant nodes in the ranking. The contextual precision score reflects the absence of relevant nodes in the retrieval contexts, which are necessary for a higher score. Since there are no relevant nodes, the score is 0.00, as there are no nodes with 'yes' verdicts to be ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The reason provided in the node clearly indicates that the retrieval context is empty and does not contribute to the query, which directly impacts the score. The absence of relevant information in the retrieval context leads to the score being 0.00, as there are no relevant nodes to be ranked above the irrelevant ones. The reason given in the node explains that the retrieval context is empty and does not contain any information about movies or their rankings, which is why it is irrelevant to the input question.
