                "The actual output provides relevant light-hearted comedy and action films with humor and shooting, but it omits many specific titles from the expected output like 'The Nice Guys,' 'Kingsman,' and 'Deadpool.' It also includes some films not mentioned in the expected output, such as 'Austin Powers' and 'My Stepmother Is an Alien,' which shifts focus slightly."
