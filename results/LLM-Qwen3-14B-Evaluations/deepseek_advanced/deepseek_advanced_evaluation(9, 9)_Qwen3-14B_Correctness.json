However, it omits specific details like directors, cast, and reasons for watching, which are present in the expected output. Some entries (e.g., 'Her', 'Ex Machina', 'Solaris') are not in the expected list, but there is no factual contradiction. Omitted details are acceptable as per the steps, so the score is 8"
