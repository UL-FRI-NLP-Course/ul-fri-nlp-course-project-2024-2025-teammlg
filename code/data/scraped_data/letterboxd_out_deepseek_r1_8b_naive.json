Ao longo da experiência, era impossível não pensar em como o filme que virou um marco da década de 90 referencia a clássica historia da princesa Cinderela.Hoje, revi \"Anora\" na pré-estreia do filme no Brasil, durante a Mostra SP, em uma sala lotada na Cinemateca e fui atravessada pela memória que citei acima quando a personagem de Mikey Madison…",
                "Yeah, I liked it👍. But Best Picture should’ve gone to the masterpiece that was 'The Beekeeper'🐝. The academy should be ashamed!👊😠#JusticeForTheBeekeeper🐝🔥🐝🔥#ProtectTheHive🔥🐝🔥🐝🔥🐝But yeah. This is pretty great too, I guess.🛩️🧣🤑💰🌃💅🏻",
                "fuck, this movie rocks.Back when Anora was first announced, I was very, very excited to go and watch it early on the big screen. It was technically my most anticipated movie of last year, though I didn't had the chance to see it due to some schedule conflicts. A year goes by, and recently I just saw it won the Palme d'Or award and as well as the best picture for the Oscars. I was in awe and made…",
                "Can’t believe it took me this long to watch this….. everyone is a star &amp; Sean Baker you can do whatever you want for the rest of your life!!!!! Ivy has the funniest line in the movie I hope Obama giggled at it when he watched this",
                "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth. The most hilarious and enjoyable film I’ve ever seen about the tragic impossibility of social mobility in the modern US.Watch my video reviewRead more at Decoding Everything",
                "Young Yanya will give off an aura,As someone who has a plethora.He and Ani will meet,Be less than discreet,As she slowly embraces \"Anora\".",
                "How can you chase something if you haven't even discovered yourself? I'm impressed with this movie. It's might seem like a typical love story, but there is so much more with its humor and ability to stress you out. It's a true definition of a dream to nightmare scenario.",
                "this is truly something special. i haven’t seen to much of sean bakers stuff, but i can definitely tell that a lot of love and care was put into this. just the whole amazing adventure along with the comedic performances are nothing but fucking phenomenal. mr and mrs academy board members make sure to make the right decision and vote Mikey madison for best actress in a leading role, thank you. not one second i felt boredom throughout this movie,…",
                "Alright Sean Baker, touché [pronounced TOOSH]...35mm.",
                "Чтож, выпьем за Шона Бэйкера«Чтоб хуй стоял и деньги были»!",
                "El sentimiento que me causa la última escena es algo incomparable este año. Increíble",
                "\"Stay jealous bitch!\"Cinema is a better place with Mikey Madison in it, specifically when she is vicious and deranged.",
                "i'm starting an igor fan club",
                "I wasn't sure where things were going when the first 40 minutes was two people doing cocaine and each other while making bad choices, but once the plot kicks in what a movie.  Absolutely compelling, entertaining and satisfying chaos. It keeps you locked in waiting to see what will happen next. The whole movie you have no idea what will happen next.",
                "While undeniably funny at times, I can’t help but find Anora incredibly miscalculated, both in marketing and its execution. A film trying to mix the hysteria and anxiety of the Safdies’ Uncut Gems and the off-beat hilarity and tone of Zola into an attempted cerebral character study. Anora’s character feels underdeveloped and sidelined. her feelings, decisions, and motivations unexplained and incoherent. Bizarre turn in from a reliable filmmaker in Baker. Questionable dialogue, questionable direction, a whole lot of questions from me.edit from march 2nd, 2025; worst best picture winner ever",
                "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth. “We don’t care about names in America.”It’s easy to pretend that we are above wishing for a fairytale ending. The world we live in doesn’t do much to support any fantasies about the future that we might have, and many pride themselves on being realistic, tough enough to endure the daily grind.Such is the case of Anni, an exotic dancer in the city of New York who makes bank by selling the fantasy of desire to lonely men…",
                "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth. few things I didn’t like. 1. the use of faggot as a major punchline. I used to be more comfortable hearing the word, and still can with friends and loved ones in the queer community, but the way it’s written in this film strikes me as a very particular type of edgelord humour that made me feel uncomfortable. the implementation bothered me particularly in a scene near the climax, where I also didn’t like the dialogue leading up to it…"
