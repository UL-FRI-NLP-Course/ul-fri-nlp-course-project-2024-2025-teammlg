                "The score is 0.20 because most statements focus on the film's production, adaptation, and reception, which are irrelevant to box-office gross, as noted in reasons like 'The statement provides general information about the film but does not address the box-office gross.' However, relevant data such as 'The film was a box-office failure, earning $109 million worldwide against a budget of $140 million.' supports some relevance, justifying the low score."
