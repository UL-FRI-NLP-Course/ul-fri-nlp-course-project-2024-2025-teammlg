                "The score is 0.67 because the retrieval context includes both relevant and irrelevant information. The statement about the film being derived from the 2015 video game but featuring an original standalone story directly answers the question about originality, while the information about the release date is also relevant. However, the context also includes irrelevant details about the film's reception and financial performance, which do not address the originality of the film's story or concept. This mix of relevant and irrelevant information results in a moderate score of 0.67, as the core question is partially addressed but not fully supported by the context provided. The focus of the question is on the film's originality, and while the context does provide some relevant information, the inclusion of extraneous details reduces the overall contextual relevancy score. The statement about the film's reception and financial performance is not relevant to the question of originality, as it does not address whether the film is based on prior works or presents new content.
