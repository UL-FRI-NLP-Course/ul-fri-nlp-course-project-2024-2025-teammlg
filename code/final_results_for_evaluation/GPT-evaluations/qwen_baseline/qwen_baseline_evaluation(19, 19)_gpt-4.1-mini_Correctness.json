                "The actual output correctly lists major live-action Superman films from the 1950s to 2020s and notes the absence of a confirmed new standalone movie after January 2025, but it omits several details present in the expected output such as specific actors, directors for all films, alternate cuts like Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, and notable animated films. It also incorrectly states no official announcement for a new movie, whereas the expected output specifies a 2025 release directed by James Gunn."
