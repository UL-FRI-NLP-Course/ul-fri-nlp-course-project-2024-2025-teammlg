                "The actual output includes MCU films up to 2025 but omits several key titles like Doctor Strange (2016), Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), and upcoming Phase 5 and 6 films. It incorrectly lists X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) as a Marvel Studios MCU film, which contradicts the expected output that separates non-MCU Fox films. Inclusion of series like Moon Knight and What If...? as films also deviates from the expected film-only list."
