                "The score is 0.60 because the response provides some relevant information about the film but contains multiple inaccuracies and irrelevant details that do not directly address the box office gross. The incorrect release year, director, adaptation source, and cast information detract from the answer's accuracy, and the mention of ticket price increases, while related to inflation, does not directly answer the question about box office gross."
