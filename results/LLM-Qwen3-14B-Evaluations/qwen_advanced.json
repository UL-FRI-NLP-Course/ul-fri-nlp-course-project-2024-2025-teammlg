There are no supportive reasons as the context provides no relevant information to confirm the expected output's accuracy or source. The unsupportive reason directly points to the absence of nodes in retrieval context, which is the main factor behind the low contextual recall score, indicating that the system failed to retrieve any relevant information to support the expected output sentence, which is the only sentence present in the expected output list.

The sentence in the expected output cannot be linked to any node(s) in retrieval context as there are none available to reference, making it impossible to validate or support the information given in the expected output based on the retrieval context provided, which is entirely absent here, thus the score is 0.00 due to the complete lack of relevant nodes in retrieval context to support the sentences in the expected output, which is a direct consequence of the retrieval context being empty and therefore not providing any basis for the statements made in the expected output, hence the score remains at 0.00 due to the retrieval context being empty, making it impossible to establish any connections between the sentences in the expected output and any nodes in retrieval context, as there are no nodes present to facilitate such a connection, thus leading to a score of 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, and therefore no nodes are available in retrieval context to support the expected output sentences, which results in a complete absence of supportive reasons and a full presence of unsupportive reasons, as indicated by the given information, leading to the score of 0.00.

Since the input specifically asks about films produced by Marvel, these irrelevant TV series references significantly lower the relevancy score."

                "The score is 0.00 because the only node in retrieval contexts is irrelevant to the input, as it discusses a Minecraft movie unrelated to Marvel's films and provides no information about Marvel's productions, as stated in the reason for that node at rank 1."

            "Contextual Recall": [
                "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, and none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context as it contains no information. The lack of relevant nodes leads to the lowest possible score of 0.00"

            "Contextual Relevancy": [
                "The score is 0.00 because there are no relevant statements in the retrieval context to answer the question about Marvel films. The reasons for irrelevancy indicate that the context does not provide any information related to the input query, and the list of relevant statements is empty, confirming the lack of contextual relevance. The input asks for specific information that is entirely absent from the retrieval context, resulting in a score of 0.00. The absence of any relevant data means the context cannot contribute to answering the query, hence the lowest possible score is assigned. The lack of any connection between the input and the retrieval context is clear, as no statements are identified as relevant, and no reasons for irrelevancy are provided, which further supports the conclusion that the context is completely unrelated to the input question. The input requires information about Marvel films, but the retrieval context does not contain any such information, making it impossible to provide a relevant answer based on the given context. The score of 0.00 reflects the complete absence of any relevant content in the retrieval context that could address the input question about Marvel films. The input query is entirely unaddressed by the retrieval context, as there are no statements that relate to Marvel films or any related topics, leading to the lowest possible score of 0.00. The lack of any relevant statements and the absence of any reasons for irrelevancy suggest that the retrieval context is completely unrelated to the input question about Marvel films, resulting in a score of 0.00.
