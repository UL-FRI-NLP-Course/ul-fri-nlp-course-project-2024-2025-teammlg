        "reply0": "Natalie Portman is not a character in the film \"V for Vendetta\". The movie, directed by Vincenzo Russo, features a masked vigilante known only as \"V\" (played by Guy Ritchie) who seeks to free the people of Britain from the oppressive rule of the government led by \"A\" (played by Christopher Eccleston)). However, in the movie, Portman's character does not appear in the film. The movie primarily features Portman's character and a few other characters played by other actors."
