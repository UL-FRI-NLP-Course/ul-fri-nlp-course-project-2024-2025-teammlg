No relevant information is present in the retrieval context to support the statements about Ben Affleck's recent film or its details, such as the release date, director, or co-stars. This lack of context results in a complete mismatch between the expected output and the available information, leading to a contextual recall score of 0.00. The absence of any nodes in the retrieval context prevents the establishment of any supportive connections, as there are no data points to reference for the sentences provided in the expected output. Therefore, the score reflects the total absence of relevant information in the retrieval context to support the given statements about the film The Accountant 2 and its related details, resulting in a score of 0.00.

                "The actual output mentions the 2019 movie, while the expected output refers to the 2025 movie. The actual output does not mention the PG rating or specific age recommendation of 8 and up, but does not contradict any facts in the expected output. Omitted details are acceptable as they are not too frequent and the core suitability for kids aligns with the expected output, though with less specificity about the rating and age range. The actual output also notes parental discretion and some potentially frightening elements, which are not in the expected output but do not contradict it directly. The difference in movie years is a factual discrepancy but not a contradiction of suitability information, as the expected output is about a future film and the actual output discusses a past one. The actual output does not mention the 2025 movie at all, which is a notable omission but not a contradiction of the expected output's content about that film, since the actual output is about a different movie altogether. The actual output does not provide the rating or age recommendation, which are key points in the expected output, but the overall message that it is suitable for kids is consistent with the expected output, albeit with less detail. The actual output is about a different movie, so the information provided is not contradictory, but the omission of key details from the expected output is significant, which affects the score but does not make it a zero as there is no contradiction.

However, since the retrieval context is currently empty, no nodes can be attributed to the expected output, and thus the score remains at 0.00. It is important to ensure that the retrieval context contains the necessary information to support the expected output in order to achieve a higher contextual recall score in the future, but in this case, the retrieval context is empty, and therefore, the score is 0.00.
