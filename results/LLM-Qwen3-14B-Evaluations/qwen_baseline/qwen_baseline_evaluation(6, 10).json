                "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, making it impossible to attribute any sentences from the expected output to it. The expected output contains detailed information about the movie Serenity, but without any relevant nodes in retrieval context to support these claims, the contextual recall score remains at zero. This indicates that the retrieval context did not provide any useful information to confirm or relate to the content in the expected output, which is why the score is 0.00 and no supportive reasons were identified. The absence of any nodes in retrieval context directly leads to the lack of support for the sentences provided in the expected output, resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00, as the system was unable to find any relevant information to back up the statements made in the expected output. The retrieval context being empty means that there is no basis for the information presented in the expected output, which is why the score is 0.00 and the unsupportive reason is that the retrieval context is empty, so no sentences can be attributed to it.

The film title and year are correct, but the actors are incorrect according to the expected output. The actual output omitted details about the co-founder of Apple, which is a significant fact from the expected output. The contradiction in actor names is a major discrepancy, leading to a score of 0 as it fails to align with the expected output's facts despite correct film information and omission of some details, which are not too frequent in this case, but the main facts are incorrect, which is critical for the score of 0"
