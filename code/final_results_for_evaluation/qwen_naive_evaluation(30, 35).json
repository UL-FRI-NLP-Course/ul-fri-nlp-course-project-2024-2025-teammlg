The absence of detailed financial metrics beyond the total gross reduces the contextual relevancy score to 0.50 despite the presence of some relevant data points about the film's financial performance and critical acclaim. The context does not include information about the film's performance in different regions or its ranking in box office charts, which would have increased the score. However, the inclusion of the total box office gross directly answers the input question, albeit not exhaustively, which is why the score is 0.50 rather than lower. The context also mentions the film's budget, which is relevant to assessing its box office performance, but without more detailed financial analysis, the relevance is only partial. Therefore, the score of 0.50 is justified as the retrieval context provides some, but not all, of the information needed to fully answer the input question about the film's box office performance. The context's mention of the film's critical reception and awards is not directly relevant to the input question but adds to the overall understanding of the film's success beyond just financial metrics. However, since the input specifically asked about box office performance, the lack of detailed financial data beyond the total gross and budget is the primary reason for the score being 0.50 rather than higher. The context's relevance is limited to the total box office gross and budget, which are the only direct financial metrics provided, but the absence of more detailed information about the film's box office performance in different markets or its ranking relative to other films reduces the overall relevancy score to 0.50. The context does not provide information on the film's box office performance in specific countries or regions, which would have been more relevant to the input question. The presence of the total box office gross and budget is sufficient to partially answer the input question, but the lack of more detailed financial data limits the score to 0.50. The context's relevance is therefore partially aligned with the input question, justifying the score of 0.50.
