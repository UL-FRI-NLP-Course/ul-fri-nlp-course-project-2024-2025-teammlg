The Other Mother's Day is a semi-personal film by Thai filmmmaker Duangtawan Sirikoon that acts as an experimental celebration of what an inclusive mother's day would feel like for a group of mothers that have been made to feel like they are 'other', outcasts, something their children are acutely aware of. A group of mothers who are: transgender; in a gay couple; in extreme poverty; covered in tattoos.  Motherhood is expressed through the opinions and cheer of both children and mother - leaving us with the abundantly clear message: why on Earth would anyone/ society question the sanctity of these children's relationships with their rightful, loving mothers? And who's really doing the damage to the children's esteem?",
