All sentences lack supporting references in the retrieval context, leading to a complete mismatch between the expected output and the available information in the retrieval context. This results in a contextual recall score of 0.00, as there is no overlap between the expected output and the retrieval context content, and no supportive reasons are present to indicate any alignment between the two datasets. Additionally, the absence of nodes in the retrieval context directly prevents the attribution of any sentence from the expected output to the retrieval context, which is a key factor in the low contextual recall score. The lack of any supportive reasons and the presence of multiple unsupportive reasons, all pointing to the same issue of an empty retrieval context, further confirm the absence of any alignment between the expected output and the retrieval context, resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00. Finally, the contextual recall score of 0.00 is a direct consequence of the retrieval context being completely devoid of any nodes that could be used to support or align with the sentences in the expected output, and the lack of any supportive reasons further emphasizes this complete lack of alignment between the two datasets.

                "The score is 0.00 because the only node in retrieval contexts is irrelevant, as it provides no information about Natalie Portman's film debut. There are no relevant nodes to rank higher, resulting in a perfect score of 0.00 for contextual precision. The reason provided in the retrieval context explicitly states this lack of information, which directly impacts the score negatively as no relevant node was retrieved to address the query about Natalie Portman's debut film. The absence of any relevant information means the contextual precision cannot be higher than zero, as there are no relevant nodes to be ranked above the irrelevant ones, which is the case here as the only node is irrelevant and thus the score remains at 0.00, since there are no relevant nodes to be ranked higher than the irrelevant ones, and the only node is irrelevant, hence the score is 0.00
