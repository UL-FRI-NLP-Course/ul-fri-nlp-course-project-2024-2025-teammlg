                "The score is 0.71 because the actual output incorrectly identifies 'Mickey 17' as a 2013 French comedy-drama directed by Vincent Monnet, whereas the retrieval context states it is a 2025 science fiction black comedy directed by Bong Joon Ho. Additionally, the actual output mentions Lambert Wilson and a plot about a man named Michel accused of murder, which contradicts the retrieval context that features Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes in a science fiction film."
