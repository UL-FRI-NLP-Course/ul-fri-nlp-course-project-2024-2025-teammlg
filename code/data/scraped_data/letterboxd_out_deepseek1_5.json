(do you choose your home or your mirror?)\u00a0worse, how do you confess that you'd trade your husband and the daughter you made together in a heartbeat for\u2026",

            "There is no sport more intimate or erotic than tennis. It is one of the few major sports where two players agree to partake, for hours, in a duel of body, mind, and soul. Naturally, to engage with anyone that intensely, an inescapable relationship is forged\u2014 one that intensifies with every stroke, every bead of sweat, every grunt. It may not be as fleshy as boxing, but arguably the lack of contact is what makes tennis more arousing\u2014 is not\u2026",

Its so fucking hot and cool and fucking entrancing and INTIMIDATINGThis is only the second movie I\u2019ve seen with Josh O\u2019Connor and I can genuinely say this man is in my top 10 favorite actors of all time. The charm this man exudes is so palpable I wanted to fuck him myself\u00a0Zendaya and Mike Faist absolutely KILLED itLuca you god damn mad man I\u2019m obsessed with you\u00a0AND THAT SOUNDTRACK COME ONNNNNNNNNNNN",
            "No because that fucking score??? I need it playing in my head 24/7!",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve missed playing with you.\u201dChallengers is centered around tennis, yes, but it\u2019s also centered around the \u2018the kiss\u2019. It\u2019s a selling point of the film and gets significant reactions at every screening. Interestingly, while technically new, a premise like this is still something more at home in the 2000s/2010s. Think about your Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or some other outrageous comedy you remember because of one shining set piece.\u00a0Art and Patrick\u2019s friendship/relationship/whatever is textually platonic. Their dialogue\u2026",

I found most of this to be really corny and predictable, which made for an experience devoid of any real tension and urgency. It fell miserably flat for me and none of the pieces came together to create something worthwhile. I rolled\u2026",
