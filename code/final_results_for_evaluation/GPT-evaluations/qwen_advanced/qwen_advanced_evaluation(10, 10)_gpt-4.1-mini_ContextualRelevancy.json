                "The score is 0.02 because the retrieval context mostly contains statements about actors playing characters other than Steve Jobs, as indicated by numerous reasons for irrelevancy such as 'Josh Gad played the character Steve Wozniak' and 'Lukas Haas played the character Daniel Kottke.' However, the relevant statement 'Ashton Kutcher played the character Steve Jobs in the movie Jobs.' directly answers the input question, justifying a low but non-zero relevancy score."
