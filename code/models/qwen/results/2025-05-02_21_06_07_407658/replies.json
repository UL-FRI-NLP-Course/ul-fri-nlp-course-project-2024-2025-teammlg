Good versus evil: The film's central conflict revolves around Batman and his team fighting against the Joker, a highly skilled and unpredictable criminal mastermind who has emerged as the most dangerous criminal in Gotham City since the release of Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face.\"\n  2.
