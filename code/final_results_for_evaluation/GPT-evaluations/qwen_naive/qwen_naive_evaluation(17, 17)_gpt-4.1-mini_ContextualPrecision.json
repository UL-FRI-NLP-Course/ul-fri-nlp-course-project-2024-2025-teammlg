Specifically, the first node in the retrieval contexts provides a comprehensive list of films scored by Hans Zimmer, and the second node offers an extensive filmography for John Williams, both directly addressing the input. Since there are no irrelevant nodes ranked above these relevant ones, the contextual precision is perfect."
