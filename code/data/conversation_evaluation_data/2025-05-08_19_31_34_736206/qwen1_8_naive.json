In several cases the actors are shown being shaved in a public location. For example, Maggie McOmie is shaved outside the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, while Robert Duvall watches a sporting event as his hair is cut off. Another actor, Marshall Efron, who would later play an insane man in the film, cut off his own hair and was filmed doing so in a bathtub.\",\n                        \"popularity\": 0.2095,\n                        \"release_date\": \"1971-03-01\",\n                        \"title\": \"Bald: The Making of 'THX 1138'\",\n                        \"character\": \"Self\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"genre_ids\": [\n                            99,\n                            10770\n                        ],\n                        \"id\": 1009030,\n                        \"original_title\": \"Crazy About the Movies: Dennis Hopper\",\n                        \"overview\": \"Hollywood's controversial creative genius, whose career spans multiple generations of moviegoers, is profiled in \\\"Crazy About the Movies: Dennis Hopper.\\\"\",\n                        \"popularity\": 0.189,\n                        \"release_date\": \"1991-05-17\",\n                        \"title\": \"Crazy About the Movies: Dennis Hopper\",\n                        \"character\": \"Self\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"genre_ids\": [\n                            99,\n                            10770\n                        ],\n                        \"id\": 294636,\n                        \"original_title\": \"The Godfather Legacy\",\n                        \"overview\": \"THE GODFATHER LEGACY goes deep inside Francis Ford Coppola's epic saga about the Corleone crime family and reveals how the Academy Award-winning film and its sequels became one of the most acclaimed franchises in Hollywood history.

Every plot in this multi-layered story seems to be at its nadir just as a pair of unlikely heroes emerge out of the backdrop to turn everything around.\",\n                        \"popularity\": 0.7624,\n                        \"release_date\": \"1999-04-19\",\n                        \"title\": \"The Florentine\",\n                        \"department\": \"Production\",\n                        \"job\": \"Producer\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"genre_ids\": [\n                            18\n                        ],\n                        \"id\": 7984,\n                        \"original_title\": \"In the Name of the Father\",\n                        \"overview\": \"A small-time Belfast thief, Gerry Conlon, is wrongly convicted of an IRA bombing in London, along with his father and friends, and spends 15 years in prison fighting to prove his innocence.\",\n                        \"popularity\": 3.5333,\n                        \"release_date\": \"1993-12-12\",\n                        \"title\": \"In the Name of the Father\",\n                        \"department\": \"Crew\",\n                        \"job\": \"Thanks\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"genre_ids\": [\n                            80,\n                            18,\n                            9648\n                        ],\n                        \"id\": 592,\n                        \"original_title\": \"The Conversation\",\n                        \"overview\": \"A paranoid, secretive surveillance expert has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that the couple he is spying on will be murdered.\",\n                        \"popularity\": 3.6589,\n                        \"release_date\": \"1974-04-07\",\n                        \"title\": \"The Conversation\",\n                        \"department\": \"Writing\",\n                        \"job\": \"Writer\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"genre_ids\": [\n                            10751,\n                            12\n                        ],\n                        \"id\": 24883,\n                        \"original_title\": \"The Black Stallion Returns\",\n                        \"overview\": \"\\\"Black\\\" is a stunning fire-and-silk stallion celebrated the world over.
