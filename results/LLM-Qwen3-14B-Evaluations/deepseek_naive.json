Additionally, the context notes the film's critical acclaim and its influence on modern superhero films, further supporting the summary of its themes and impact.

            "Contextual Recall": [
                "The score is 0.14 because only the first sentence has partial alignment with the retrieval context, but the mismatch in release dates (2009-09-30 vs. 2025) and all other sentences lack corresponding information in the retrieval context, leading to a low contextual recall score. The retrieval context (node 1) mentions 'Slovenia' with a release date of 2009-09-30, which does not match the 2025 date in the expected output, resulting in a 'no' for that sentence as well. Other sentences mention Cineplexx Slovenia, digital availability, specific platforms, streaming on Max, Warner Bros. window, and additional sources like Decider and Cosmopolitan, none of which are found in the retrieval context, leading to no matches for these sentences. The overall low score reflects the minimal overlap between the expected output and the retrieval context, with only a partial match on the Slovenia premiere that is invalidated by the date discrepancy. The retrieval context (node 1) is the only node mentioned, and it fails to support most of the information in the expected output, contributing to the low score of 0.14. The lack of supporting information for the majority of the sentences in the expected output, combined with the invalid partial match, results in the low contextual recall score of 0.14, indicating a poor alignment between the retrieval context and the expected output, with only a minor and incorrect match on the Slovenia premiere date, and no support for the rest of the content in the expected output, leading to a very low score of 0.14.

This discrepancy indicates a lack of strict adherence to the provided information, thereby reducing the faithfulness score from a perfect 1.0 to 0.67. However, the output may have accurately covered other aspects of the movie, contributing to the moderate score of 0.67, which suggests that while there are inaccuracies, the majority of the information is still aligned with the retrieval context, albeit with notable exceptions that warrant the reduction in the faithfulness score.

The input requires current film information, which is entirely absent from the retrieval context, making it impossible to derive an answer from the given data. The retrieval context neither contains any data about Ben Affleck's filmography nor any related information that could be inferred to answer the question, thus resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00.
