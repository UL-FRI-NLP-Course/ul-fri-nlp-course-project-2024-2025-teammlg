                "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses a 2005 documentary about 1950s science fiction movies, which does not mention any Superman films or upcoming releases, yet it is ranked highest. Similarly, the second node is about a 1930 drama film unrelated to Superman movies but is ranked above any relevant content. This misranking of irrelevant nodes at the top results in the lowest possible contextual precision score."
