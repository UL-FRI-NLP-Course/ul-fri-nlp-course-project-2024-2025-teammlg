                "i'm like christopher nolan in that i want cillian murphy in my stuff",
                "To this day it baffles me why Cillian Murphy isn't more famous.",
                "If I took away anything from this movie, it was a greater appreciation for The Dark Knight.",
                "hilarious how much the death of Bruce‚Äôs father drives this film, given that the actual moment of his death is just so‚Ä¶ blah. and his mother is there too, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it from how little bruce (or Nolan) seems to care. peak nolan!",
                "instead of turning him into a demon the fear gas should've given batman's suit nipples",

                "Why did the Batman franchise fall? So that it could learn to pick itself up! And it did! IT REALLY DID!!!After the franchise that began with Tim Burton's Batman in 1989 hit an absolute dead end with Joel Schumacher's Batman &amp; Robin in 1997, Warner Bros. decided to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch, all over again. And in their effort to recreate the saga of the Caped Crusader from the ground up with a more realistic approach,‚Ä¶",
                "Did not remember this feeling so close to the Tim Burton Batman movies, but it does. Bale lumbers around awkwardly in a giant rubber suit, the bad guy wants to gas the city into submission, and Gotham is stylized and nightmarish with giant monorails and a slum called ‚ÄúThe Narrows.‚Äù That‚Äôs not necessarily a criticism or a compliment, merely an observation. Batman didn‚Äôt go full Nolan until The Dark Knight.This has aged nicely, at least up until the big‚Ä¶",

                "you guys are gonna be like ‚ÄúSHUT UP ABOUT FRASIER!!!‚Äù but ‚Ä¶ every time they called Cillian Murphy ‚ÄúDr. Crane‚Äù i was losing it. i know that the character of Scarecrow predates the hit Emmy-winning NBC sitcom by 50 years, but the fact that they‚Äôre both psychologists + the sheer number of times they say his name = absurd. even Batman says ‚ÄúDr. Crane‚Äù!anyway, i‚Äôm the last person on Letterboxd dot com who hasn‚Äôt seen the entire Nolan Batman‚Ä¶",
                "i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been a ‚Äúserious‚Äù Batman movie. just a bunch of directors with wildly different takes on ‚Äúfun‚Äù",

                "An unpopular (?) opinion around these parts, but this is one of my least favorite Christopher Nolan films. Every scene involving the Tumbler is golden and some of the story decisions are intriguing (e.g. Joe Chill, the Ra‚Äôs al Ghul twist), but a lot of this movie is just an anticlimactic jumble of awful child actors, ugly design choices, and horrendously edited fight scenes‚Äînot to mention the Nolan Batman cycle‚Äôs overall habit of putting amateurish expository dialogue into the mouths‚Ä¶",

                "hopelessly colored by the increasingly comic portent of its massively popular sequels (and their aggressively vocal fans), this nevertheless remains an idiosyncratic and relatively clean take on material that, at least cinematically, had strayed far enough from its core concepts that a reboot actually felt necessary. using a dedication to \"realism\" and the character's deep-rooted emotional trauma as galvanic elements on their own isn't a particularly new tack, but using them to sow seeds of ambivalence toward the very idea‚Ä¶",
                "This movie is a lot sillier than most people remember. It has ninjas, demonic visions, fire breathing horses, an army of bats and a plot to vaporize all the water in the city to make people go insane.",
                "Last time I was on vacation, I opened the umbrella over a picnic table and a bat that had been asleep in its folds fell out. It hopped up and flew around me, confused and annoyed. It was kind of scary, but I got over it.",

                "I can't be the only one who thinks the Batman suit in this looks a little silly right",

It's also the only one of the trilogy I've never seen from beginning to end until now.As for the film itself, I really like how the script not only explains how fear played a big part in the creation of this icon, but carries this theme throughout‚Ä¶",
                "really wish we got a whole movie of Bruce being a criminal in China, but I guess that wouldn‚Äôt be a Batman movie.anyway, it‚Äôs insane how hard the sword fight in the middle of the frozen lake still rocks",

                "About as good as an origin can get really. It‚Äôs insane that The Dark Knight is so great it makes people undermine how much of a banger this is.",
                "Used to like this one as much if not more than The Dark Knight when I was younger on the grounds that this was very tightly locked into its central character arc, and progressed through it with a confident sense of momentum, trying to give an inherently silly character his most thorough and grounded explanation both in terms of psychology and real-world practicality. And I'd still say (a few idiotic Goyer-isms aside) that Nolan is mostly successful at it, while‚Ä¶",

                "Perhaps late to the party on this, but it occurs to me that Bruce Wayne is the rare blue flower that Ducard wants him to pick and bring to Ra's al Ghul as a test of his resolve. It blossoms only under harsh conditions and if it survives its journey it can transform into something more than its physical form to instill great fear in the minds of others.",
