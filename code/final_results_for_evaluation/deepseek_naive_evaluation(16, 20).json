This indicates that the output accurately reflects the content of the retrieval context, ensuring reliability and correctness of the information presented to the user. However, it is important to note that the absence of contradictions does not necessarily imply the presence of correct or accurate information, but rather that the output does not contradict the retrieval context.

Therefore, while the faithfulness score is high, it is still necessary to verify the accuracy of the information presented in the actual output against other reliable sources or data to ensure its correctness and validity. In conclusion, the high faithfulness score indicates that the output is consistent with the retrieval context, but further verification is recommended to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to the user. The user is advised to consult additional sources or data to confirm the correctness of the information presented in the actual output, as the absence of contradictions does not guarantee the presence of correct or accurate information.
