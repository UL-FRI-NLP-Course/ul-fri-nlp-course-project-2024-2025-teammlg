As a result, none of the information about Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent film projects can be attributed to any nodes, leading to a complete lack of contextual recall match. This explains the 0.00 score as the system couldn't find any relevant information to align with the expected output sentences, which detail his roles, co-stars, directors, and other related details in recent films and series, including The Man with the Bag, FUBAR, and Secret Level, among others, with specific details about each project's status, platform, and genre, as well as behind-the-scenes notes about his role as Santa Claus and director Adam Shankman's involvement. However, without any retrieval context, these details cannot be linked to any existing nodes, resulting in no supportive reasons and only unsupportive reasons being identified, which all indicate that the retrieval context was completely empty and provided no basis for any of the information in the expected output to be attributed to it, thereby resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00 for contextual recall in this case, as there was absolutely no overlap between the expected output and the retrieval context, which was empty and provided no relevant information to support any of the sentences in the expected output, which detailed Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent film projects, co-stars, directors, and other related details, as well as behind-the-scenes notes about his role as Santa Claus and director Adam Shankman's involvement in The Man with the Bag, which is a 2025 Christmas action-comedy film directed by Adam Shankman, with filming completed in late 2024, and release date yet to be announced, and which is Schwarzenegger's first holiday film since Jingle All the Way (1996)."
