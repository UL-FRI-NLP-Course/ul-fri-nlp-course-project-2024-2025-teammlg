            "I love natalie Portman and I hate the government",
            "Someone: *says any word starting with the letter V*Me: ah, nice V for Vendetta reference",
            "i'm like natalie portman in this film because after watching this i, too, became bald.",
            "if you were on tumblr in 2008 and reblogged a gif of Natalie Portman crying while her head got shaved you’re a leftist now",
            "according to the imdb trivia, keira knightley auditioned for this. actual english person keira knightley, who is often mistaken for natalie portman, auditioned for the role of evey, and then lost to her american lookalike",
            "evey: yeah v physically and emotionally tortured me and imprisoned me and shaved my head but its all good cause we’re in love",
            "When people tell me Marvel comic book movies are better than DC comic book movies, I can't help but to laugh. Then I tell them to go watch: V for Vendetta, Watchmen, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. QUALITY over quantity, people. Marvel can make as many movies as they want, but they lack the ability to make something that actually has compelling substance. I've got nothing against Marvel, I like most of their movies. I just don't find their movies…",
            "I hate, HATE that I’m so attracted to V",
            "A vehemently crafted, voraciously told &amp; vigorously acted cinematic vessel with a valuable &amp; vivified voice that's as veracious as it is vengeful, V for Vendetta visualises an uncompromising vision of a vile &amp; vexatious future our increasingly venomous world is visibly veering towards, and is by all means a valorous &amp; victorious effort.Vicariously scripted by the Wachowskis and valiantly directed by James McTeigue in his very first venture, this vividly visualised voyage of a vigilante cast by vicissitudes of fate who veneers…",
            "Anonymous hacker man with a slightly above average vocabulary blows up buildings, terrorizes politicians with riddles, and M'lady's his way into Natalie Portman's heart. I'm not even joking.",
            "If I were Evey I could excuse V torturing me and chopping my hair off, but what I could not excuse is that WIG!!!",
            "Remember, remember, on the 5th of November, that this movie is overrated as fuck.",
            "I fucking dare you to watch this post 2020",
            "Every 5th of November I’m reminded about how much I love Natalie Portman and how much I hate the government.",
            "I wish I could shave off all my hair and have bags under my eyes and still look as pretty as Natalie Portman",
            "This mf said ideas are bulletproof lol. Extremely corny, simplistic adaptation but I read the graphic novel at an impressionable age and still have affection for some of the ideas regarding Thatcherism &amp; power and the Wachowskis attempt to contextualize the Iraq War into Moore's goofy, apocalyptic vision of them. Also Hugo, God of enunciating.",
            "W E L I V E I N A S O C I E T Y",
            "I do like this film's ambitions to be a smart blockbuster, but it ends up feeling like a watered down version of a greater ideal (in this case: the graphic novel it is based on).I don't have too much good to specifically say about this film, but overall it does function as a decent blockbuster. It has its exciting moments and the core plot is interesting and mostly engaging. There's a few decent mindless action scenes as well. Hugo…",
            "padme snapped",
            "\"Remember, remember, the 5th of November\"  Happy 5th of November :)",
            "doesn't it just make perfect sense that the man walking through fire wearing nothing but a G-string in this film would go on to direct the John Wick movies",
            "This is one of the most unstructured, worst edited, weirdly acted movies I have ever seen!But I do get it in a way, it’s cool.",
            "“Are you like a crazy person?” “I am quite sure they will say so.”",
            "(Watched for Film Analysis) This is Joker but... better.",
            "My nostalgia for it will never let me truly despise this, but it’s such a flat adaptation that works only because Portman and Weaving are very good at what they do.If you would have asked me at 16, I would have said it was the coolest and most groundbreaking movie in the world. I guess this is growing up.",
            "Somehow this movie manages to hit harder and harder everytime I watch it, especially in 2020.Comic/Superhero Movies Ranked 9/10",
            "I love Natalie Portman but I love british bald Natalie Portman even more",
            "V is the physical representation of trying to add fancy language to your English assignment to meet the page limit.It had a lot of engaging themes and some entertaining scenes. It's just a shame that so much of the film is bland and cliché.",
            "Hold up... did I just watch an episode of The Simpsons because they just predicted the goddamn future 15 years later um—",
            "the houses of parliament blowing up to tchaikovsky.... now THAT'S cinema",
            "Yearly reminder that this film is awful and forgets all the political complexity of Moore's original work.",
            "so there are definitely dudes who insist on wearing this mask during sex huh",
            "Anarchy has never looked so well-spoken.",
            "Remember, remember...",
            "\"A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget.\"One of the best movies I've ever watched. It's currently #4 on my Top 150 list. I first watched it when I was 13 and have been watching it non-stop ever since. It's definitely the movie I rewatch the most. Few movies have instilled a more “rebellious” atmosphere in audiences than V for Vendetta. The film begins with a reference to Guy Fawkes,…",
