                "Could not take Bruce Wayne seriously whenever he wore a suit, like I'm sorry that is just Patrick Bateman to me",
                "thomas wayne: bruce, why do we fall?me, screaming: SO WE CAN LEARN TO PICK OURSELVES UP",
                "scarecrow: you look like a man who takes himself too seriously. do you want my opinion? you need to lighten up [sets batman on fire]me: ICONIC!!!!!!!!",
                "\"Tell them that joke you know.\" Bruce Wayne doesn't get enough credit for being a funny guy!",
                "the best part of this movie is cillian murphy's cheekbones. everything else pales in comparison.",
                "I plan to preach about the talents of Cillian Murphy until the day I die",
                "i'm like christopher nolan in that i want cillian murphy in my stuff",
                "To this day it baffles me why Cillian Murphy isn't more famous.",
                "If I took away anything from this movie, it was a greater appreciation for The Dark Knight.",
                "hilarious how much the death of Bruce’s father drives this film, given that the actual moment of his death is just so… blah. and his mother is there too, but you wouldn’t know it from how little bruce (or Nolan) seems to care. peak nolan!",
                "instead of turning him into a demon the fear gas should've given batman's suit nipples",
                "batman should've tossed king joffrey off that balcony",
                "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth. imagine genuinely thinking that liam neeson is the best fit for a character called ra's al ghul",
                "Cillian Murphy's face is too sweet, I can't take him seriously as a villain.",
                "imagine thinking that I wouldn't die for cillian murphy as jonathan crane",
                "“what, they don’t like falafel?”",
                "Throat cancer Batman is the best Batman",
                "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth. Batman to Ra’s al Ghul: Yeah I’m not going to kill you, that’s not really my thing...but I will, however, witness you burn and die as the train you are on is currently derailing and will be obliterated into pieces in a matter of seconds 🙃I love this trilogy",
                "ahhhh what a wonderful nap... thank you for that one Nolan 🙏",
                "*fake coughs* ugh! i’m so sick i need a doctor! (specifically jonathan crane though)",
                "Why did the Batman franchise fall? So that it could learn to pick itself up! And it did! IT REALLY DID!!!After the franchise that began with Tim Burton's Batman in 1989 hit an absolute dead end with Joel Schumacher's Batman &amp; Robin in 1997, Warner Bros. decided to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch, all over again. And in their effort to recreate the saga of the Caped Crusader from the ground up with a more realistic approach,…",
                "Did not remember this feeling so close to the Tim Burton Batman movies, but it does. Bale lumbers around awkwardly in a giant rubber suit, the bad guy wants to gas the city into submission, and Gotham is stylized and nightmarish with giant monorails and a slum called “The Narrows.” That’s not necessarily a criticism or a compliment, merely an observation. Batman didn’t go full Nolan until The Dark Knight.This has aged nicely, at least up until the big…",
                "This film cast Tom Wilkinson as an Italian-American crime figure named Carmine Falcone.",
                "nolan to the concept artist for batman begins: i want monorails covering gotham citynolan to the artist for the dark knight: so the monorails were a bad idea...",
                "me: cillian murphy isn’t /that/ good looking idk what the hype is all abo-cillian murphy: puts on glassesme: call me old fashioned, but i was raised to take care of my husband, make his plate every night, wash his work clothes for him, make sure he’s up for work the next morning, and always have a clean house for him to come home to",
                "cillian murphy can show me his mask ANYTIME",
                "Imagine thinking that the Dark Knight Trilogy isn't the best Batman adaptation...",
                "In terms of origin stories, this is A-Tier. A brilliant introduction to a trilogy that would go on to being one of the greatest ever.",
                "alfred the goat fr",
                "what, they don't like falafel?",
                "if cillian murphy psychopath why sexy 😩",
                "The first tumbler sequence is still wildly entertaining. Why did we never see more of that bat sonar thing? Seemed like it would have come in handy.",
                "Look at my doctor dawgggg I’m goin to the insane asylum😫🤯🤣",
                "Batman began",
                "you guys are gonna be like “SHUT UP ABOUT FRASIER!!!” but … every time they called Cillian Murphy “Dr. Crane” i was losing it. i know that the character of Scarecrow predates the hit Emmy-winning NBC sitcom by 50 years, but the fact that they’re both psychologists + the sheer number of times they say his name = absurd. even Batman says “Dr. Crane”!anyway, i’m the last person on Letterboxd dot com who hasn’t seen the entire Nolan Batman…",
                "i don’t think there’s ever been a “serious” Batman movie. just a bunch of directors with wildly different takes on “fun”",
                "my mums phone autocorrected the word ‘batman’ to ‘barman’ and she texted my brother telling him we were watching ‘barman begins’ and he responded with “he doesnt serve a pint until the sequels” me and my mum have been in tears for 30 minutes now",
                "pulling narrative inspiration from year one, legends of the dark knight, daughter of the demon, and the man who falls, while taking aesthetic inspiration from gotham by gaslight and the dark knight returns. so much foundational source material coming together so beautifully to create a detailed and rewarding experience, highlighting the very best of these characters and gotham lore. you’re just one man? / now we’re two. / we?this sequence in particular stood out this time around. an exchange between…",
                "An unpopular (?) opinion around these parts, but this is one of my least favorite Christopher Nolan films. Every scene involving the Tumbler is golden and some of the story decisions are intriguing (e.g. Joe Chill, the Ra’s al Ghul twist), but a lot of this movie is just an anticlimactic jumble of awful child actors, ugly design choices, and horrendously edited fight scenes—not to mention the Nolan Batman cycle’s overall habit of putting amateurish expository dialogue into the mouths…",
                "can't wait to see robert pattinson being hot like this as Batman",
                "hopelessly colored by the increasingly comic portent of its massively popular sequels (and their aggressively vocal fans), this nevertheless remains an idiosyncratic and relatively clean take on material that, at least cinematically, had strayed far enough from its core concepts that a reboot actually felt necessary. using a dedication to \"realism\" and the character's deep-rooted emotional trauma as galvanic elements on their own isn't a particularly new tack, but using them to sow seeds of ambivalence toward the very idea…",
                "This movie is a lot sillier than most people remember. It has ninjas, demonic visions, fire breathing horses, an army of bats and a plot to vaporize all the water in the city to make people go insane.",
                "Last time I was on vacation, I opened the umbrella over a picnic table and a bat that had been asleep in its folds fell out. It hopped up and flew around me, confused and annoyed. It was kind of scary, but I got over it.",
                "i’m here to say that no one will ever top christian bale as batman. period",
                "I can't be the only one who thinks the Batman suit in this looks a little silly right",
                "who gave Liam Neeson the right to be so tall",
                "Sometimes I think this movie is better than The Batman.",
                "Action! - Three Auteurs: Timing Nolan &amp; The Mind Bending MachineThe film that kickstarted not only a trilogy, but a whole new era in cinema in and out of the superhero genre. It's also the only one of the trilogy I've never seen from beginning to end until now.As for the film itself, I really like how the script not only explains how fear played a big part in the creation of this icon, but carries this theme throughout…",
                "really wish we got a whole movie of Bruce being a criminal in China, but I guess that wouldn’t be a Batman movie.anyway, it’s insane how hard the sword fight in the middle of the frozen lake still rocks",
                "SWEAR TO ME",
                "Lacks a good villain. Fortunately they fixed that in the sequels.Comic/Superhero Movies Ranked 9/10",
                "About as good as an origin can get really. It’s insane that The Dark Knight is so great it makes people undermine how much of a banger this is.",
                "Used to like this one as much if not more than The Dark Knight when I was younger on the grounds that this was very tightly locked into its central character arc, and progressed through it with a confident sense of momentum, trying to give an inherently silly character his most thorough and grounded explanation both in terms of psychology and real-world practicality. And I'd still say (a few idiotic Goyer-isms aside) that Nolan is mostly successful at it, while…",
                "i'd let christian bale as batman punch me really hard",
                "Why do we fall Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.",
                "Perhaps late to the party on this, but it occurs to me that Bruce Wayne is the rare blue flower that Ducard wants him to pick and bring to Ra's al Ghul as a test of his resolve. It blossoms only under harsh conditions and if it survives its journey it can transform into something more than its physical form to instill great fear in the minds of others.",

My wife really wanted to watch it, and even though I was working on something, we turned it on. I lost all hope of finishing what I was working on after about 20 minutes because this was just too good. Even though I have seen it countless times, I just couldn’t…",
                "Somehow, rewatching this made me even more in love with Cillian Murphy, and he's an awful person in this movie, so who even knows what's going on.",
                "Really cool tone here. Could be interesting to see it applied to a Superman movie sometime in the future. Maybe get the guy who directed Dawn of the Dead and Sucker Punch 🤜!",
                "this movie still rules."
