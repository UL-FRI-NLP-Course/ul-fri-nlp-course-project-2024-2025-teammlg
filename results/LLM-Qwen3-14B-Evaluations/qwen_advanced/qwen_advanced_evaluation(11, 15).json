The absence of contradictions in the actual output is a strong indicator of the model's high level of accuracy and its ability to generate responses that are fully aligned with the retrieval context. This results in a faithfulness score of 1.00, which is a strong indicator of the model's capability to produce reliable and contextually accurate responses. The high score reflects the model's ability to maintain consistency and accuracy, ensuring that the information provided is both trustworthy and aligned with the original retrieval context. The perfect score of 1.00 is a direct result of the absence of contradictions, which confirms that the actual output is a precise and accurate reflection of the retrieval context. This demonstrates the model's ability to generate responses that are not only faithful but also highly reliable and free from any inaccuracies or discrepancies. The lack of contradictions in the actual output is a clear sign of the model's strong performance in maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context, resulting in a top score of 1.00. The high faithfulness score is a testament to the model's precision and reliability in generating responses that are fully aligned with the information provided in the retrieval context. The absence of contradictions ensures that the actual output is a true and accurate representation of the retrieval context, making it a model example of a faithful response. The perfect score of 1.00 is a clear indication that the model has successfully generated a response that is both accurate and fully consistent with the retrieval context, without any deviations or inaccuracies.
