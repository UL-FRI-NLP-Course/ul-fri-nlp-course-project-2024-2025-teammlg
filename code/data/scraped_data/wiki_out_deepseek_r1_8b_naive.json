            "plot": "Anora \"Ani\" Mikheeva, a 23-year-old stripper, lives in Brighton Beach, a Russian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. Her boss introduces her to Ivan \"Vanya\" Zakharov, the 21-year-old son of the Russian oligarch Nikolai Zakharov, who requests someone fluent in Russian. Though Vanya is in the U.S. to study, he spends most of his time partying in clubs and playing video games in his parent's lavish Brooklyn mansion.\nVanya hires Anora for several sexual encounters. He invites her to a New Year's Eve party at the mansion, and the following day, he offers her $15,000 to be his girlfriend for a week. During the week, Anora parties with Vanya and his friends, and they all go on an extravagant trip to Las Vegas. At the end of the trip, Vanya reveals that he has to return to Russia permanently to work at his father's company and expresses disdain for his parents. He suggests that he will not have to leave if he marries an American and impulsively proposes marriage. Anora is reluctant at first but agrees after Vanya assures her that his feelings are genuine. They elope at a Vegas wedding chapel. Vanya then buys her a large wedding ring and an expensive fur coat. She resigns from her job and moves into Vanya's mansion. When news of their marriage reaches Russia, Vanya's mother, Galina, orders his Armenian godfather, Toros, to find them and arrange an annulment while she and his father, Nikolai, fly to the U.S.\nToros sends his henchmen, Garnik and Igor, to the mansion. They inform Vanya that his parents are taking him back to Russia and enrage Anora by calling her a prostitute, suggesting Vanya only married her for a green card. Vanya flees the premises, and Anora engages in a violent struggle with Garnik and Igor before they restrain her. When Toros arrives, he tells Anora that Vanya's mansion and wealth belong to his parents and that he is immature and financially dependent on them. He confiscates her wedding ring, gags her, and offers her $10,000 for the annulment. Anora insists she and Vanya are in love, but she agrees to help find him.\nAnora, Toros, Garnik, and Igor search Brooklyn. Anora learns from friends that Vanya is at her former strip club, where he is being entertained by Diamond, a rival dancer. They drag Vanya out of the club, but he is too intoxicated to listen to them, and the group is forced to wait outside the courthouse overnight. The annulment is dismissed since the marriage took place in Nevada.\nAt the airport, Anora introduces herself to Nikolai and Galina in Russian, but Galina rejects her. Conceding to his parents, Vanya coldly tells Anora their marriage must end while Galina orders everyone onto a plane to Las Vegas. Having not signed a prenuptial agreement, Anora pledges to file for a divorce settlement, but Galina threatens her with financial ruin if she does not comply. Realizing Vanya's cowardice and his family's power, Anora signs the annulment papers. Igor suggests Vanya apologize to Anora, but Galina objects. Anora insults both Vanya and Galina before leaving, telling Galina that Vanya only got married to spite her.\nIgor takes Anora back to New York to collect her belongings. At the mansion, she confronts Igor about their encounter, accusing him of assault and saying he would have raped her if they had been alone; Igor assures her he is simply not a rapist and had no intention of doing so. The next morning, Igor gives Anora the money Toros promised her and drives her home. In the car, he returns her wedding ring as a token of goodwill. Moved by the gesture, Anora initiates sex with him but stops when he tries to kiss her; she breaks down and sobs in his arms."
