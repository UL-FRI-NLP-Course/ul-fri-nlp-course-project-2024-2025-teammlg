            "plot": "British intelligence officer George Woodhouse is given one week by his superior, Meacham, to investigate the leak of a top-secret software program code-named Severus. One of five suspects is his wife, Kathryn, who is also an intelligence officer. He invites the other four suspects, also SIS operatives, over for dinner. The four suspects are satellite imagery specialist Clarissa, her boyfriend and managing agent Freddie, managing agent James and his girlfriend Zoe, who is also the agency psychiatrist. At dinner, George drugs their food to lower their inhibitions. In an effort to learn more about his guests, George engages them in a psychological game. Amongst other things, it is revealed that Freddie has been cheating on Clarissa, to which Clarissa responds by stabbing Freddie in the hand with a steak knife.\nThat same evening, Meacham dies of a heart attack while drinking in his home. George begins to focus on Kathryn after finding a ticket to a movie theatre in her dresser waste basket, and she denies having seen the film. He tricks her into giving him access to her office, logs into her computer and learns that she will be traveling to Zurich. He persuades Clarissa to redirect a spy satellite and watches Kathryn meet with an expatriate Russian operative in Switzerland. Later, James informs George that Kathryn has access to a Zurich bank account containing £7 million in misdirected and unexplained funds. In a psychiatric session, Zoe asks if Kathryn prioritizes her career or her husband. In a subsequent session, Zoe breaks up with James.\nIt is revealed that during the few minutes George redirected the satellite to watch Kathryn's meeting in Zurich, another expat Russian operative disappeared from a Liechtenstein safehouse with a copy of the Severus program, and he is now en route to Eastern Europe to use it to cause a nuclear meltdown. Clarissa tells Freddie, with whom she has reconciled, about her involvement, and Freddie secretly warns Kathryn that George suspects her. In bed that night, the couple compare notes and realize they are being set up. Kathryn uses Clarissa to track the Russian. She suspects that their boss, Stieglitz, deliberately leaked Severus to cause a nuclear meltdown and destabilize the Russian government even though it would kill thousands of innocent people. She leaks the expat Russians' location to a CIA contact, resulting in a drone strike that kills them as they travel through Poland. George subjects all suspects except Kathryn to a polygraph test to determine who might be behind the leak.\nThey invite the other four suspects to a second dinner party. Instead of serving dinner, Kathryn places a gun on the table while George announces they will play a game in which he asks each of them a single question. His questions reveal several secrets, including that Freddie and Zoe had an affair, and that Zoe learned of the Severus program from James and attempted to stop its dissemination due to her Catholic faith. George states that there were two plots: one by Stieglitz and James to leak Severus and cause a nuclear meltdown, and another by Zoe and Freddie to use Kathryn to stop it. James grabs the gun, confesses to plotting with Stieglitz and killing Meacham, and fires at George twice. However, the gun was loaded with blanks. Kathryn pulls a gun from her bag and kills James, after which she firmly warns the remaining colleagues to never exploit her and George's mutual fidelity again. George dumps James's body in the fishing pond. Kathryn informs Stieglitz that his plot failed and suggests he remove himself from his position. She and George reaffirm their love for each other. At Kathryn's questioning, George reveals that the Zurich bank account containing £7 million is still untouched."
