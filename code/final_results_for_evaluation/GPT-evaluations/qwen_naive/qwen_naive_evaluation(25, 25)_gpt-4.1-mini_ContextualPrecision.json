                "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant to the input question. For example, the first node, ranked 1st, provides detailed information about the movie 'The Marvels' but does not list films produced by Marvel Studios, which is the requested information. Similarly, the other nodes either contain unrelated reviews, mention 'services' without relevant film information, or are empty, thus none of the nodes offer relevant content to justify a higher score."
