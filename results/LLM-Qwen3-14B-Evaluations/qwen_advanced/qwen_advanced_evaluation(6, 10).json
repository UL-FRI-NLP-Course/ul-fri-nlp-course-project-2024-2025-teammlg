            "Contextual Relevancy": [
                "The score is 0.05 because the retrieval context primarily contains irrelevant names such as Steve Wozniak, Daniel Kottke, and others, which do not answer the question about the actor who played Steve Jobs. However, the statement 'Ashton Kutcher played Steve Jobs in the movie Jobs' is directly relevant and provides the correct answer, though it is overshadowed by the majority of irrelevant information, leading to a very low contextual relevancy score despite the presence of the correct answer in the context."
