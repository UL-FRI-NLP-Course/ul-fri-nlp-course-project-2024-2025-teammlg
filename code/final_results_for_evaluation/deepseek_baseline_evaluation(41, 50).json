                "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, making it impossible to attribute any sentences from the expected output to it. All sentences in the expected output lack corresponding supportive information in the retrieval context, resulting in a complete absence of contextual recall. The lack of any nodes in the retrieval context directly leads to the unsupportive reason provided, which explains the zero score. This situation highlights the necessity of having relevant retrieval context to establish any meaningful connections with the expected output sentences, which was not present here. The absence of any supportive reasons further emphasizes that the expected output cannot be linked to the retrieval context, leading to the lowest possible score of 0.00. This underscores the critical role of retrieval context in determining the contextual recall score, as without it, no connections can be made, and thus, the score remains at zero. The retrieval context's emptiness is the primary factor contributing to the zero score, as there are no nodes in the retrieval context to support any of the sentences in the expected output. This absence of nodes in the retrieval context is the root cause of the zero score, as it prevents any alignment between the expected output and the retrieval context, making it impossible to establish any supportive reasons.

Without relevant information in the retrieval context, there is no basis for contextual recall, resulting in a score of zero. This explains why none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any node in retrieval context, as there are no nodes to reference. The absence of any content in the retrieval context directly leads to the lowest possible score, indicating a complete lack of alignment between the expected output and the retrieval context. This is the primary reason for the score being 0.00, as no supportive reasons were provided, and all reasons are unsupportive due to the empty retrieval context. The score reflects that there is no overlap or connection between the information in the expected output and the retrieval context, hence the score remains at 0.00, as the retrieval context provides no basis for any alignment or recall.
