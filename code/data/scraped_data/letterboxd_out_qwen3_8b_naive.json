So smart, and so sexy, without ever being sensual. Real lover cinema. There’s a simple scene that is exactly two shots long in a movie theater early on, and it made me think back to Cate Blanchett’s very first line and…",

                "mostly a mixed bag with some hints of something great sprinkled throughout. it’ll lean positive in my rating thanks to a really solid set of performances and a few fun exchanges here and there. no pair better than fassbender and blanchett to play hard-ass husband-wife in a test of loyalty and betrayal. it’s nowhere near the level of ambition and sexiness the trailer had promised and its writing can come off a bit elementary but, regardless, it was fun watching this ensemble go back and forth while this (relatively) intriguing web unraveled. certainly offered up some admirable laughs (one dinner scene in particular).",

Fassbender and Blanchett are something special here. Legitimately one of the best love stories of the past 10 years. Soderbergh, you dog.“For a minute there, I thought you were human.”",
                "Steven Soderbergh’s cooly romantic “Black Bag” might present itself as a chatty little thriller in the vein of John le Carré, but this slinky movie’s semi-compelling spycraft is almost entirely in the service of testing the marriage between two of Britain’s most elite security operatives — of asking just how much full transparency really matters between two people who have always been faithful to each other where it counts. Every couple has its secrets, but at what point does love…",

                "An exercise in sustained foreplay. From Black Bag’s opening tracking shot, it’s clear we’re watching something measured and refined. The desire to cast secrets out into the light so they can be fully seen is at odds with how clouded the very light is, halation ensuring every artificial light source is foggy. No easy answers, no easy resolutions, it’s never so simple with games like this. Caught myself grinning almost non-stop throughout.We talked about Black Bag and many more of the March releases in the House of Cinema March 2025 Recap, available now wherever you listen to podcasts :)",
                "Once again Soderbergh seems to be very amused with himself. This is immaculately constructed but it's also a pretty airless spy riff; sorta funny, a little sexy, but not really all that funny or sexy. Works on paper but since there's no reason to invest in the marriage and the spy narrative is underwhelming by design, it just felt like another Sodey exercise, and I might be getting a little bored with those.",

                "Halfway through Black Bag, Marisa Abela’s barb-tongued satcom specialist, Clarissa, rhetorically interrogates an entire subgenre: “When you can lie about everything, when you can deny everything, how do you tell the truth about anything?” Steven Soderbergh, in a sexy, zero-fat, 94 minutes, answers the question in the most unexpected way. Black Bag sure is steamy — Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett playing married spooks certainly heightens its seductiveness — but its real heat lies in its surprising juxtaposition, honing in on a passionate kernel of loyalty and devotion within a sea of spy-versus-spy cynicism: the ultimate, lean expression of “couple goals.”",
                "Snappily paced and essentially frictionless, with a rare (but to my eyes, blatantly) miscalibrated Blanchett performance; not the face of Sphinx-like mystery but a figure of cool indifference, and as such a good enough avatar for Black Bag itelf.

                "-I was an impressionable wannabe cinephile in the late 1990s when Soderbergh started hitting with one stylish film after another. I saw every single one in the theater; Out of Sight, The Limey, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Ocean’s Eleven. Those movies are burned into my brain.

But…",

The genre’s hallmarks provide a sleek and comfortable juxtaposition to the often deliberate violence. Black Bag is decidedly more elegant and relaxed than the latter. It’s much more enjoyable because of it. Black Bag uses excellent performances, a great sense of style, and complexly clever writing to create an entertaining and tense relationship drama masquerading as a spy thriller.Read the rest of this review here.",

When I have people over, I have to chuck three, four, or seventeen items into my Murphy closet five minutes before my guests arrive just to maintain a facade of fastidiousness. This is all to say that we gotta do something about Cate and Mike’s apartment.

                "I mean, come on, y’all. Soderbergh’s out here just screaming for this medium to do better—and giving a master class in the process. This is such a sleek, sexy, funny, smart, and oh-so-easily-watchable Ass Magnet Movie for adults. Wowza. At the moment, my favorite of the year.",

                "\"Would you kill for me, George?\" Fun, fast paced, sleek, sexy, and stylish. Witty dialogue. Exciting score. Great opening, great ending, killer polygraph scene, and at only 90 minutes it's all kept tight and close together. (Maybe too close? I could've used an extra 15 minutes) Fassbender and Blanchett are unsurprisingly great. Back to Black's Marisa Abela is a scene stealer. As someone who's never been a Soderbergh fan this makes two wins in a row for the auteur, in fact Black Bag may just be my favorite of his filmography.",
                "Every couple of years Soderberg unties himself from experimentation and digs in with both fists to do a big, sleek, capital F film with movie stars, proper lighting, good cameras and all the rest of it, and fuck I wish he did it more often.",

                "So, spy tea, huh?Black Bag feels like a throwback in the best way: late 2000s stylish drama between many players, with twists and turns, under the concept of espionage, and with a smartly written script. The characters take center stage thanks to an excellent cast. That makes up for a lack of action, a surprising choice for a movie featuring spies. But it works. 84%",

Giving Eastwood a run for his money...) but you'll have to be a real good listener to take away anything from this glorified stageplay which is overly drab and obvious. The performances are good and fine except for a couple, but if going in blind just know you're not walking into a clever heist caper or an engaging spy thriller, and prepare for a mediocre off-Broadway show with perhaps a couple of your favourite players. There's just not much meat to it, and I say that as a vegan. Next time, Steve, next time... which will be when... next month?",

                "Pretty extraordinary that just two months after his (also excellent) Presence hit theatres, Steven Soderbergh can put out another, even better film in Black Bag. This espionage thriller is basically everything I could want out of a mid-budget movie aimed at adults and with a stellar cast at its disposal, as Soderbergh takes the straightforward, unfussy style he applies to his filmmaking and matches it perfectly to this kind of picture.
