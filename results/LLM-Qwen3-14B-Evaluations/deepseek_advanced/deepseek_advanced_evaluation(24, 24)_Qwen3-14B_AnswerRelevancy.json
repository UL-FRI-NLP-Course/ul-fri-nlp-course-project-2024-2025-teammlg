                "The score is 0.95 because the answer correctly identified that X-Men: Apocalypse is a 20th Century Fox film, not produced by Marvel Studios. However, the mention of it being part of the X-Men film series, separate from the MCU, slightly detracts from the relevance as the question specifically asks for films produced by Marvel, not just related series."
