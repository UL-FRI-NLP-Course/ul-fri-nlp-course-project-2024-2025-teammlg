However, it's important to note that this outcome is not a reflection of the quality of the expected output but rather an indication of the absence of necessary information in the retrieval context to support the contextual recall process. In such scenarios, the contextual recall score is inevitably zero, as there are no nodes in the retrieval context to which any part of the expected output can be linked, thus rendering the score as 0.00.
