The relevant statements describe the story's events, but the reason for irrelevancy notes that these do not address the film's factual basis, supporting a high but not perfect relevancy score."

The reasons for irrelevancy note that many plot details 'do not mention gore or blood' directly, indicating partial but incomplete relevance to the input question."
