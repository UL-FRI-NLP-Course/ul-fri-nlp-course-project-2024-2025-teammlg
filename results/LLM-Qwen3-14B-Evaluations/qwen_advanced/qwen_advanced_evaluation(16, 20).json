                "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, so there are no statements to evaluate for relevance to the input question about Steven Spielberg's age. No relevant statements were found in the context to address the query about his age, leading to a score of 0.00 as there is no information available to provide an answer or establish any connection to the question asked about Steven Spielberg's age. This lack of context means the query cannot be addressed with the given information, resulting in the lowest relevancy score possible, 0.00, as no data is present to support any answer or relevance to the input question about Steven Spielberg's age. The absence of any statements in the retrieval context directly correlates to the inability to determine any relevancy, thus the score remains at 0.00, indicating that the context does not contribute to answering the question about Steven Spielberg's age in any way. The lack of information in the retrieval context is the primary reason for the score being 0.00, as no data is available to determine the age of Steven Spielberg or to provide any related information that could be used to answer the question posed. This absence of data means that the retrieval context cannot be used to answer the question about Steven Spielberg's age, resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00 for contextual relevancy, as there is no information to establish any connection between the retrieval context and the input question about Steven Spielberg's age. The context being empty is the main factor leading to the score of 0.00, as there are no statements provided that can be evaluated for relevance to the question about Steven Spielberg's age, making it impossible to determine any level of contextual relevancy.
