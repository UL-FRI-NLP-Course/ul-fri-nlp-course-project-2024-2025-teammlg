                "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, making it impossible to attribute any sentences from the expected output to it. There are no supportive reasons as no information is available in the retrieval context to align with the provided data on 2024 action films. All sentences in the expected output remain unconnected due to the absence of relevant nodes in retrieval context, leading to a complete lack of contextual recall match. The unsupportive reason explicitly states this emptiness as the core issue preventing any alignment between the expected output and the retrieval context, thus resulting in a score of 0.00. The retrieval context's emptiness is the sole factor affecting the score, as there are no nodes to reference for matching the information in the expected output sentences, which includes details on films, actors, directors, and release dates. This absence directly correlates to the inability to support any of the sentences in the expected output, hence the score is 0.00 due to the retrieval context being devoid of any relevant information for the given task of contextual recall matching. The lack of nodes in the retrieval context is the critical factor leading to the score of 0.00, as there are no elements to support the sentences provided in the expected output, which includes film details, cast members, and release dates, all of which cannot be linked to any existing nodes in retrieval context. Therefore, the score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, and there are no nodes present to support the information in the expected output, resulting in a complete absence of contextual recall alignment.

The context also contains information about the film's plot and critical reception, which are irrelevant to the question, further lowering the score.
