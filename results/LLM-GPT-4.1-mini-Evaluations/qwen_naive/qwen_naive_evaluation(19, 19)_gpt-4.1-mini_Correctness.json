                "The actual output lists major Superman films from the 1950s to present, including TV series and key live-action movies, but omits several important films like 'Superman and the Mole Men' (1951), 'Superman Returns' (2006), and the upcoming 'Superman' (2025) with James Gunn. It also incorrectly includes 'Batman & Robin' (1997) as a Superman movie and lacks mention of notable animated films and director's cuts present in the expected output."
