The input requires current film information, which is entirely absent from the retrieval context, making it impossible to derive an answer from the given data. The retrieval context neither contains any data about Ben Affleck's filmography nor any related information that could be inferred to answer the question, thus resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00. Additionally, the absence of any provided reasons for irrelevancy suggests that the retrieval context was not evaluated for its content, further supporting the conclusion of complete irrelevance to the input question.
