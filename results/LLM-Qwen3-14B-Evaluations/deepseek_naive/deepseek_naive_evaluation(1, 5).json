            "Contextual Recall": [
                "The score is 0.14 because only the first sentence has partial alignment with the retrieval context, but the mismatch in release dates (2009-09-30 vs. 2025) and all other sentences lack corresponding information in the retrieval context, leading to a low contextual recall score. The retrieval context (node 1) mentions 'Slovenia' with a release date of 2009-09-30, which does not match the 2025 date in the expected output, resulting in a 'no' for that sentence as well. Other sentences mention Cineplexx Slovenia, digital availability, specific platforms, streaming on Max, Warner Bros. window, and additional sources like Decider and Cosmopolitan, none of which are found in the retrieval context, leading to no matches for these sentences. The overall low score reflects the minimal overlap between the expected output and the retrieval context, with only a partial match on the Slovenia premiere that is invalidated by the date discrepancy. The retrieval context (node 1) is the only node mentioned, and it fails to support most of the information in the expected output, contributing to the low score of 0.14. The lack of supporting information for the majority of the sentences in the expected output, combined with the invalid partial match, results in the low contextual recall score of 0.14, indicating a poor alignment between the retrieval context and the expected output, with only a minor and incorrect match on the Slovenia premiere date, and no support for the rest of the content in the expected output, leading to a very low score of 0.14.
