This partial relevance justifies the low score."

                "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context includes relevant information about the film 'Paris' (2008) being a comedy-drama set in Paris, which aligns with the input's request for a dramedy in Paris, much of the context is irrelevant as it focuses on an unrelated animated fantasy film and unrelated similar movies. This mix of relevant and irrelevant information justifies the moderate relevancy score."
