                "The score is 0.53 because the actual output incorrectly assigns many films and series to MCU phases they do not belong to, such as including non-MCU films like The Wolverine (2013), Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Aquaman, Shazam!, and Barbie in MCU phases, misclassifying Phase Two and Three films like Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron as Phase One, and including non-MCU titles like Deadpool, X-Men films, Blade Runner 2049, and Futurama in Phase Three. These significant inaccuracies reduce faithfulness to the retrieval context."
