                "The score is 0.94 because the actual output correctly identifies Zachary Levi as Shazam in the film, but mistakenly refers to him as young Superman. This contradiction is minor and does not significantly impact the overall faithfulness to the retrieval context, which accurately describes the film's content and cast roles as Shazam and Superman being separate characters portrayed by different actors, with Levi playing Shazam and Superman being a different character in the movie, as indicated by the retrieval context. The error in the actual output is a minor misattribution of the character played by Levi, but the overall information provided aligns closely with the retrieval context, justifying the high faithfulness score of 0.94, as the main points of the film's content and cast are correctly represented, with only a small error in the specific character portrayed by Levi, which is a minor detail compared to the overall accuracy of the information presented, as the retrieval context also mentions that the movie features Shazam alongside Superman, indicating that the main characters are distinct, and the actual output's mistake is a minor misstatement that does not significantly affect the overall faithfulness of the output to the retrieval context, as the core information about the film's content and cast is accurate, with the exception of the minor error in the character played by Levi, which is a small misattribution compared to the overall accuracy of the information presented in the actual output, which is mostly in line with the retrieval context, as the retrieval context also states that the movie is an action-packed adventure featuring Shazam alongside Superman, which is consistent with the actual output's description, except for the minor misattribution of the character played by Levi as young Superman instead of Shazam, which is a minor error that
