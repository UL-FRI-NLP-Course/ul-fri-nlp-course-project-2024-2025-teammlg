                "The actual output contains some factual inaccuracies, such as incorrectly stating Jon Favreau directed both Lion King versions and Zimmer's involvement in the 2024 remake, which contradicts the expected output. It also omits several notable films like Dunkirk, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Man of Steel, but overall the facts presented are mostly consistent and detailed."
