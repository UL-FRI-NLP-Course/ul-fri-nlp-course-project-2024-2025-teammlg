            "i don't think i will ever not be angry with the nolan batman films.but let's just focus on this one scene. the \"some men just want to watch the world burn\" scene. because it is the perfect evidence for just how committed nolan's films are to casting anyone resisting oppressive systems as villains.alfred: a long time ago, i was in Burma, my friends and i were working for the local government. they were trying to buy the loyalty‚Ä¶",

            "I got really sick of hearing about this movie, it inspired a lot of bad trends, it has a ton of terrible friends, and there's some stuff in there that doesn't work. But you know what? On a whole it's exhilarating and riveting and contains like 800 great scenes.",
            "Isn't it funny that true classics can stand up to decades of close scrutiny and critical analysis, yet still retain their standing among the greatest films of all time...but a deluge of completely obvious flaws in today's so-called \"masterpieces\" are immediately evident upon first viewing?Let's begin this review by asking a question: what does it mean for a film to be \"intelligent\" or \"mature\"?

You‚Äôve got a surprising majority of people claiming it‚Äôs a cinematic masterpiece - the next CITIZEN KANE, 10/10, A++, ‚Äúwould let Chris Nolan fingerbang my senses again‚Äù - alongside a smaller but equally vocal minority lamenting that it‚Äôs the most vile, disgusting, contrived, and overrated waste of space ever created.
