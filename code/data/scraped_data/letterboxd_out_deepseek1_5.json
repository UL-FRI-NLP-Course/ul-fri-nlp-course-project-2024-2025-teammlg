            "smashing year. cant wait for the next one to finish xx",
            "Only proves that you can't make a good feature on One plus nine. Shardul Bhardwaj was fantastic in his role",
            "Lowkey a mid ass year not gonna lie. The family vacation I took in May was the highlight for sure, going to Universal for the first time and seeing the Bates Motel up-close is a memory I'll cherish. Then November happened lmao. I'm just hoping for a better 2025.",
            "Dou uma nota 6.5 pra esse ano, come√ßou meio incerto n sabia Direito onde tava indo mas mais pro final tomou um rumo q faz sentido. Achei q podia ter dado uma quebrada Nas cenas mais dramaticas, o roteirista do ano pareceu q focou demais na parte do conflito e n resolveu as coisas. Mas no final da pra ter varios aprendizados, por isso Acho q n foi uma experiencia desperdi√ßada. N pretendo rever esse filme mas to ansioso pra sequencia 2025",
            "2024 best jaartje, veel nieuwe dingen geprobeert en gekeken. Fuck ik heb zelfs een horrorfilm aangezet. Niet zoveel gekeken als wat ik hoopte maar er zaten echt shocks bij. Dit jaar heb ik voor het eerst Whiplash gekeken rn dat was zeker een hoogtepunt.In 2025 ga ik zeker voor de 100 films rn dat moet zeker lukken. Ik ga eerst die van mission impossible kijken rn daarna een paar andere must-sees. Beste wensen!!!",
            "Every little once in awhile üòâ",
            "I'm living this rn",
            "Met the director.A lovely, humble, wonderful and inspiring man.Good mentor, ideal mentor.",
            "Brilliantly shot.Was quite impressed with the BGM, and then the credit showed - Alokananda Dasgupta (Sacred Games, Leila).",
            "Say hi somewhere else.the.fotoapp.co/almaonlywordsyouknow.bsky.socialletterboxd.com/9413/lists/by/popularopen.spotify.com/user/h71lox2em9atyhnsa1xs2r35uinstagram.com/takenbyapicturesignal.me/#eu/2VLGumP2simxeBSS9b17M_2U56SnSBVDiACj8ieURb0mubHoGelBLqPd5YCxblA6substack.com/@alma",
            "ripoff zombie movie",
            "Not much carefully made.",
            "Shot on One Plusüëåüèº Good Background score. These worked for me and that's about it.Felt very Zombie-ish film in a way based on tropes tried.Post Apocalypse idea with C 24..Stressful to say the least imagining the present situation!",
            "Great efforts taken!",
            "Shot on OnePlus 9Pro.",
            "The sheer effort to shoot the entire film on a One Plus camera and the grounded recreation of the chaos associated with the newly mutated fictional C-24 virus genuinely deserves a huge round of applause. But with the emotional layer, which would have been the icing in the cake deeply failing to meet the expectations and unwanted back to back flashback, which has been poorly executed makes this film topple towards an average experience. If only the running time extended‚Ä¶",
            "Nice effort.",
            "What a ride! A pretty fascinating and unflinching fictional depiction of how adversely a virus could unsettle and wreck a town in no time. Given the way COVID-19 shook the world it won't be a surprise if we happen to face more of such dreadful situations in near future, which makes this film horrifying to some extent. Rohin Raveendran Nair shot this feature film on OnePlus 9 which is quite commendable as this 60 min feature film is totally worthwhile.",
            "Fiction + SENTIMENT",
            "Cool!!! Shot on OnePlus"
