                "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in retrieval contexts are irrelevant to the user's request. For example, the first node ranked 1st discusses a 'Comedy' and 'Horror' film about teens at a rehabilitation camp, which does not align with the request for light entertainment featuring lots of shooting and funny one-liners. Similarly, the second node ranked 2nd focuses on ideological themes and family dynamics, unrelated to action-comedy films. The third and fourth nodes ranked 3rd and 4th provide no relevant information for recommending suitable films. Since no relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant ones, the score is appropriately low."
