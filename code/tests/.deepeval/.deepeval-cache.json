With Henson's first appearance on September 18, 1966, The Muppets began to capture America's imagination, breaking down our old conceptions of what could be done with puppetry, challenging us to embrace these creatures as living and thinking beings. Not only does this program introduce us to Kermit, we can also see the beginnings of other Henson characters we've come to know and love, including reindeer discussing Christmas deliveries, singing cows, a monster engulfing a computer, and Kermit swallowing a worm. The charm and warmth that captured children and adults when these inventive segments first aired are just as powerful and compelling today. As you will see...  The Muppets' charm and lore are timeless!\\\",\\n                        \\\"popularity\\\": 0.1122,\\n                        \\\"release_date\\\": \\\"2003-01-01\\\",\\n                        \\\"title\\\": \\\"Muppets Magic From 'The Ed Sullivan Show!'\\\",\\n                        \\\"character\\\": \\\"Muppet Performer\\\"\\n                    },\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"genre_ids\\\": [\\n                            99,\\n                            10770\\n                        ],\\n                        \\\"id\\\": 358536,\\n                        \\\"original_title\\\": \\\"When Star Wars Ruled the World\\\",\\n                        \\\"overview\\\": \\\"A VH1 television special wherein the cast discuss the making of the films and what made the franchise a phenomenon.\\\",\\n                        \\\"popularity\\\": 0.3125,\\n                        \\\"release_date\\\": \\\"2004-09-18\\\",\\n                        \\\"title\\\": \\\"When Star Wars Ruled the World\\\",\\n                        \\\"character\\\": \\\"Self\\\"\\n                    },\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"genre_ids\\\": [\\n                            99\\n                        ],\\n                        \\\"id\\\": 360081,\\n                        \\\"original_title\\\": \\\"In Their Own Words: Jim Henson\\\",\\n                        \\\"overview\\\": \\\"The film follows Henson\\u2019s career from his first work with his Muppets in the early 1950\\u2019s during television\\u2019s Golden Age up to his sudden and shocking death in 1990, as he transcended puppetry to become one of the most creative, prolific and influential artists of his time.

The event, for which ticket-buyers paid up to $1,000 a seat (tax-deductible as a contribution to the Actors' Fund) was billed as \\\\\\\"The Night of 100 Stars\\\\\\\" but, actually, around 230 stars took part. And most of the audience of 5,800 had no idea in advance that they were paying to see a TV taping, complete with long waits for set and costume changes, tape rewinding, and the like.  Executive producer Alexander Cohen estimated that the 5,800 Radio City Music Hall seats sold out at prices ranging from $25 to $1,000. The show itself cost about $4 million to produce and was expected to yield around $2 million for the new addition to the Actors Fund retirement home in Englewood, N. J.

It is based on the 2014 novel Levon's Trade by Chuck Dixon. The film stars Jason Statham, Michael Pe\\u00f1a, and David Harbour.\\\\nA Working Man was released in the United States by Amazon MGM Studios and in the United Kingdom by Warner Bros. Pictures on March 28, 2025. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $98 million worldwide against a $40 million budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"plot\\\": \\\"Levon Cade, an ex-Royal Marine Commando, works as a construction foreman in Chicago and has a very close friendship with the Garcia family \\u2013 Joe, his wife, Carla, and their daughter, Jenny \\u2013 that runs the company. However, he struggles to gain custody of his daughter, Merry, after his wife committed suicide. Merry is now living with Levon\\u2019s father-in-law, Dr. Jordan Roth, who refuses to let him see Merry when he was deployed.  \\\\nOne night, while Jenny is out hanging with her friends, she is kidnapped by Russian traffickers Viper and Artemis. Joe and Carla reported their missing daughter to the police, but they were unable to find any leads to Jenny. Desperate, the parents offer Levon a sum of money to help them find their daughter, but Levon refuses, citing that he wants to move on from his military life. Still unsure, Levon consults with his old friend, Gunny, a blind ex-Marine Raider, who suggests doing what is right for the Garcia family, so Levon takes matters into his own hands to bring her back home. He tracks down to Jenny's last location in a bar where she was hanging out with her friends and the bartender, Johnny. He follows Johnny back to his home and interrogates him before two more thugs arrive. Levon kills all three of them and learns that the bartender and the thugs are working for the Bratva, a Russian mafia crime syndicate with Symon Kharchenko as the enforcer.  \\\\nSymon's high-ranking captain, Wolo Kolisnyk, discovers the carnage and has a clean-up crew remove the evidence, but Levon follows him to his private estate where he interrogates Wolo before drowning him in a chair in his private pool. Symon learns of Levon's activities and sends his sons Danya and Vanko to kill Levon.  \\\\nUsing his contacts from the DEA, Levon infiltrates the organization by pretending to be a dealer to get close to Wolo's son Dimi, who runs the trafficking part of the organization with a biker gang and their leader, Dutch. However, Danya and Vanko chase Levon and manage to capture him (helped in the process by two corrupted cops), but he kills them and crashes the van into a river. Symon learns of his son\\u2019s deaths and summons the other high-ranking mafia members to exact revenge on Levon. He gets all of Levon's personal information, including his father-in-law and Merry. Symon sends his men to tie up Jordan and set his home ablaze to kill him, but Levon manages to save him. Levon takes Merry to stay with Gunny while he heads out to fight the mafia. \\\\nLevon brutally interrogates Dimi and gets him to lead him to the compound where Jenny is being kept before he executes Dimi. He gears up and attacks the compound, killing every criminal in his path, including Dutch and his biker gang. Levon finds Jenny, and kills the client and Viper, while Jenny strangles Artemis. Symon arrives to see Levon and Jenny riding away, and calls for backup; however, his boss orders him to leave Levon alone because of how dangerous Levon is and can bring down the mafia, and that nobody in the organization is going to help him in his crusade for vengeance if he goes rogue. \\\\nLevon reunites Jenny with her family and returns home to have dinner with Merry and Gunny.\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output does not provide a definitive answer, while the expected output states 'No'.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "Qwen/Qwen3-14B", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradict any facts in 'expected output'\",\n    \"Ommited details are acceptable, as long as they are not too frequent\"\n] \n \nRubric:\nNone"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "Qwen/Qwen3-14B", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": false, "evaluation_steps": ["Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradict any facts in 'expected output'", "Ommited details are acceptable, as long as they are not too frequent"], "evaluation_params": ["actual_output", "expected_output"]}}, {"metric_data": {"name": "Clarity (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The response uses clear and direct language, provides a straightforward answer, and does not contain unnecessary repetition or confusion.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "Qwen/Qwen3-14B", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Evaluate whether the response uses clear and direct language.\",\n    \"Identify any vague or confusing parts that reduce understanding.\",\n    \"Identify any unnecessary repetition of information in the response.\"\n] \n \nRubric:\nNone"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "Qwen/Qwen3-14B", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": false, "evaluation_steps": ["Evaluate whether the response uses clear and direct language.", "Identify any vague or confusing parts that reduce understanding.", "Identify any unnecessary repetition of information in the response."], "evaluation_params": ["actual_output"]}}, {"metric_data": {"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The score is 1.00 because the answer directly addresses the question by confirming that Frank Oz is not in the film 'A Working Man' and provides a brief explanation about his role as a puppeteer for The Muppets, which is relevant to the query about his filmography.

The film stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Sergio Castellitto, and Isabella Rossellini. In the film, Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Fiennes) organizes a conclave to elect the next pope and finds himself investigating secrets and scandals about the major candidates.\\\\nAfter premiering at the 51st Telluride Film Festival on 30 August 2024, Conclave was released in theaters in the United States by Focus Features on 25 October 2024 and in the United Kingdom by Black Bear UK on 29 November 2024. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, directing, screenplay, and cinematography. The film has grossed $125.9 million worldwide on a $20 million production budget. The film experienced a resurgence in popularity following the death of Pope Francis in April 2025 and the subsequent conclave in May that resulted in the election of Pope Leo XIV, who reportedly saw the movie.\\\\nConclave was named one of the top ten films of 2024 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute. Among other accolades, it won four awards at the 78th British Academy Film Awards (tying The Brutalist for most of the ceremony), including Best Film, and also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. At the 97th Academy Awards, it received eight nominations, including Best Picture, and won Best Adapted Screenplay.\\\\n\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"plot\\\": \\\"After the pope dies of a heart attack, the College of Cardinals, under the leadership of its dean, Thomas Lawrence of the United Kingdom, convenes to elect a successor. The four cardinals who emerge as likely candidates are Aldo Bellini of the United States, a progressive reformer; Joshua Adeyemi of Nigeria, a social conservative; Joseph Tremblay of Canada, a moderate; and Goffredo Tedesco of Italy, a staunch traditionalist.\\\\nArchbishop Janusz Wo\\u017aniak, the prefect of the papal household, tells Lawrence that the pope demanded Tremblay's resignation before dying, which Tremblay denies. Bellini, meanwhile, tells his supporters that his goal is to prevent Tedesco from winning the papacy. Lawrence is surprised by the last-minute arrival of Mexican-born Archbishop Vincent Ben\\u00edtez of Kabul, whom the pope named cardinal in pectore the previous year.\\\\nLawrence opens the deliberations with an impromptu homily encouraging the college to embrace uncertainty, which some interpret as an open declaration of his papal ambition. No one obtains the two-thirds majority necessary to win, though Adeyemi commands a lead over Tedesco and Tremblay while Bellini and Lawrence split the progressive vote. Monsignor Raymond O'Malley, Lawrence's assistant, discovers the pope paid for Ben\\u00edtez to be flown to Geneva for a medical appointment that Ben\\u00edtez later canceled.\\\\nOn the second day, the college witnesses an altercation between Adeyemi and Sister Shanumi, a Nigerian nun recently transferred to Vatican City. Lawrence speaks with Shanumi, who confesses to a past illicit relationship that led to the birth of a son. Adeyemi confirms the story when pressed. Though Lawrence is bound to secrecy, a whisper campaign derails Adeyemi's candidacy. Bellini reluctantly decides to back Tremblay.\\\\nWorking with Sister Agnes, the nun acting as head caterer and housekeeper, Lawrence discovers that Tremblay arranged for Shanumi's transfer. When confronted, Tremblay claims he did so at the pope's request. Lawrence then breaks into the pope's sealed apartment, where he finds documents indicating Tremblay paid cardinals for votes. He shows the documents to Bellini, whose plea not to reveal their existence sparks an argument.\\\\nOn the third day, Lawrence and Agnes publicize Tremblay's actions, effectively removing Tremblay from contention. Lawrence then reconciles with Bellini and agrees to stand against Tedesco. He votes for himself during the deliberations, but before he can cast his vote, he is blown off his feet by an explosion that damages the Sistine Chapel. The college learns the explosion was one of a series of suicide bombings currently occurring throughout Europe. While Tedesco demands a religious war against Islam, Ben\\u00edtez argues against meeting violence with violence and chastises everyone for prioritizing their political agendas over their shared religious mission.\\\\nVoting resumes, and as light shines through a broken window, the college overwhelmingly elects Ben\\u00edtez, who chooses the papal name of \\\\\\\"Innocent\\\\\\\". Lawrence is initially enthusiastic until O'Malley pulls him aside to discuss Ben\\u00edtez's canceled medical appointment. When confronted by Lawrence, Ben\\u00edtez reveals he was born with a uterus and ovaries but was unaware of their existence until an appendectomy revealed them. The appointment was for a laparoscopic hysterectomy that he decided against, believing he should remain as God made him. Lawrence wanders the Vatican grounds, listening to the crowds cheer Pope Innocent's election, before returning to his room, opening the window and observing a trio of young nuns chattering in the courtyard below.\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual

and release dates, but lacks detailed data on its box office performance relative to other films or specific market breakdowns. The context mentions critical reception and awards but does not address the input's focus on box office success comprehensively, leading to partial relevance. The absence of detailed financial metrics beyond the total gross reduces the contextual relevancy score to 0.50 despite the presence of some relevant data points about the film's financial performance and critical acclaim. The context does not include information about the film's performance in different regions or its ranking in box office charts, which would have increased the score.

The context also mentions the film's budget, which is relevant to assessing its box office performance, but without more detailed financial analysis, the relevance is only partial.

The four cardinals who emerge as likely candidates are Aldo Bellini of the United States, a progressive reformer; Joshua Adeyemi of Nigeria, a social conservative; Joseph Tremblay of Canada, a moderate; and Goffredo Tedesco of Italy, a staunch traditionalist. Archbishop Janusz Wo\\u017aniak, the prefect of the papal household, tells Lawrence that the pope demanded Tremblay's resignation before dying, which Tremblay denies. Bellini, meanwhile, tells his supporters that his goal is to prevent Tedesco from winning the papacy. Lawrence is surprised by the last-minute arrival of Mexican-born Archbishop Vincent Ben\\u00edtez of Kabul, whom the pope named cardinal in pectore the previous year. Lawrence opens the deliberations with an impromptu homily encouraging the college to embrace uncertainty, which some interpret as an open declaration of his papal ambition. No one obtains the two-thirds majority necessary to win, though Adeyemi commands a lead over Tedesco and Tremblay while Bellini and Lawrence split the progressive vote. Monsignor Raymond O'Malley, Lawrence's assistant, discovers the pope paid for Ben\\u00edtez to be flown to Geneva for a medical appointment that Ben\\u00edtez later canceled. On the second day, the college witnesses an altercation between Adeyemi and Sister Shanumi, a Nigerian nun recently transferred to Vatican City. Lawrence speaks with Shanumi, who confesses to a past illicit relationship that led to the birth of a son. Adeyemi confirms the story when pressed. Though Lawrence is bound to secrecy, a whisper campaign derails Adeyemi's candidacy. Bellini reluctantly decides to back Tremblay. Working with Sister Agnes, the nun acting as head caterer and housekeeper, Lawrence discovers that Tremblay arranged for Shanumi's transfer. When confronted, Tremblay claims he did so at the pope's request. Lawrence then breaks into the pope's sealed apartment, where he finds documents indicating Tremblay paid cardinals for votes. He shows the documents to Bellini, whose plea not to reveal their existence sparks an argument. On the third day, Lawrence and Agnes publicize Tremblay's actions, effectively removing Tremblay from contention. Lawrence then reconciles with Bellini and agrees to stand against Tedesco. He votes for himself during the deliberations, but before he can cast his vote, he is blown off his feet by an explosion that damages the Sistine Chapel. The college learns the explosion was one of a series of suicide bombings currently occurring throughout Europe. While Tedesco demands a religious war against Islam, Ben\\u00edtez argues against meeting violence with violence and chastises everyone for prioritizing their political agendas over their shared religious mission. Voting resumes, and as light shines through a broken window, the college overwhelmingly elects Ben\\u00edtez, who chooses the papal name of \\\"Innocent\\\". Lawrence is initially enthusiastic until O'Malley pulls him aside to discuss Ben\\u00edtez's canceled medical appointment. When confronted by Lawrence, Ben\\u00edtez reveals he was born with a uterus and ovaries but was unaware of their existence until an appendectomy revealed them. The appointment was for a laparoscopic hysterectomy that he decided against, believing he should remain as God made him. Lawrence wanders the Vatican grounds, listening to the crowds cheer Pope Innocent's election, before returning to his room, opening the window and observing a trio of young nuns chattering in the courtyard below.\",\n                \"verdict\": \"no\",\n                \"reason\": null\n            },\n            {\n                \"statement\": \"The film's plot is a detailed narrative of the conclave process, involving political intrigue, personal secrets, and the election of a new pope.

While it delves into psychological tension and suspense, it does not incorporate elements typical of the horror genre, such as supernatural occurrences or explicit scares.\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Is Black Bag a horror film?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"{\\n    \\\"Black Bag\\\": {\\n        \\\"info\\\": {\\n            \\\"adult\\\": false,\\n            \\\"original_language\\\": \\\"en\\\",\\n            \\\"original_title\\\": \\\"Black Bag\\\",\\n            \\\"overview\\\": \\\"When intelligence agent Kathryn Woodhouse is suspected of betraying the nation, her husband \\u2013 also a legendary agent \\u2013 faces the ultimate test of whether to be loyal to his marriage, or his country.\\\",\\n            \\\"popularity\\\": 20.1155,\\n            \\\"release_date\\\": \\\"2025-03-12\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Black Bag\\\",\\n            \\\"video\\\": false,\\n            \\\"vote_average\\\": 6.33,\\n            \\\"vote_count\\\": 538,\\n            \\\"genres\\\": [\\n                \\\"Thriller\\\",\\n                \\\"Mystery\\\",\\n                \\\"Drama\\\"\\n            ]\\n        },\\n        \\\"similar\\\": [\\n            \\\"The End We Start From\\\",\\n            \\\"The Spy\\\",\\n            \\\"Blackmail\\\",\\n            \\\"The Poseidon Adventure\\\",\\n            \\\"Die Hard\\\",\\n            \\\"Frenzy\\\",\\n            \\\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\\",\\n            \\\"The Hours\\\",\\n            \\\"The Conversation\\\",\\n            \\\"Trainspotting\\\",\\n            \\\"Stalag 17\\\",\\n            \\\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\\",\\n            \\\"Lost Highway\\\",\\n            \\\"When Harry Met Sally...\\\",\\n            \\\"Dr. No\\\",\\n            \\\"Belle de Jour\\\",\\n            \\\"From Russia with Love\\\",\\n            \\\"Thunderball\\\",\\n            \\\"The Marriage of Maria Braun\\\",\\n            \\\"Twister\\\"\\n        ],\\n        \\\"cast\\\": {\\n            \\\"cast\\\": [\\n                {\\n                    \\\"gender\\\": 1,\\n                    \\\"known_for_department\\\": \\\"Acting\\\",\\n                    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Cate Blanchett\\\",\\n                    \\\"original_name\\\": \\\"Cate Blanchett\\\",\\n                    \\\"popularity\\\": 5.0843,\\n                    \\\"character\\\": \\\"Kathryn St. Jean\\\"\\n                },\\n                {\\n                    \\\"gender\\\": 2,\\n                    \\\"known_for_department\\\": \\\"Acting\\\",\\n                    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Michael Fassbender\\\",\\n                    \\\"original_name\\\": \\\"Michael Fassbender\\\",\\n                    \\\"popularity\\\": 8.3496,\\n                    \\\"character\\\": \\\"George Woodhouse\\\"\\n                },\\n                {\\n                    \\\"gender\\\": 2,\\n                    \\\"known_for_department\\\": \\\"Acting\\\",\\n                    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Tom Burke\\\",\\n                    \\\"original_name\\\": \\\"Tom Burke\\\",\\n                    \\\"popularity\\\": 3.2698,\\n                    \\\"character\\\": \\\"Freddie Smalls\\\"\\n                },\\n                {\\n                    \\\"gender\\\": 1,\\n                    \\\"known_for_department\\\": \\\"Acting\\\",\\n                    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Marisa Abela\\\",\\n                    \\\"original_name\\\": \\\"Marisa Abela\\\",\\n                    \\\"popularity\\\": 2.291,\\n                    \\\"character\\\": \\\"Clarissa Dubose\\\"\\n                },\\n                {\\n                    \\\"gender\\\": 2,\\n                    \\\"known_for_department\\\": \\\"Acting\\\",\\n                    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Reg\\u00e9-Jean Page\\\",\\n                    \\\"original_name\\\": \\\"Reg\\u00e9-Jean Page\\\",\\n                    \\\"popularity\\\": 4.3448,\\n                    \\\"character\\\": \\\"Col.

Steven Soderbergh has made a slick, stylized espionage thriller that tries to showcase his signature flair for visual storytelling and tight pacing, but fails by a marginal factor.

The characters take center stage thanks to an excellent cast. That makes up for a lack of action, a surprising choice for a movie featuring spies.

The narrative follows a British intelligence officer who is assigned to investigate a confidential list of suspected traitors, only to discover that one of the names on the list is his own wife.\\\\nThe film was released theatrically in France on March 12, 2025, by Universal Pictures, followed by a United States release on March 14 through Focus Features. It received widespread critical acclaim for its performances and direction but underperformed commercially, grossing $41.2 million worldwide against a production budget estimated between $50 and $60 million.\\\",\\n            \\\"plot\\\": \\\"British intelligence officer George Woodhouse is given one week by his superior, Meacham, to investigate the leak of a top-secret software program code-named Severus. One of five suspects is his wife, Kathryn, who is also an intelligence officer. He invites the other four suspects, also SIS operatives, over for dinner. The four suspects are satellite imagery specialist Clarissa, her boyfriend and managing agent Freddie, managing agent James and his girlfriend Zoe, who is also the agency psychiatrist. At dinner, George drugs their food to lower their inhibitions. In an effort to learn more about his guests, George engages them in a psychological game. Amongst other things, it is revealed that Freddie has been cheating on Clarissa, to which Clarissa responds by stabbing Freddie in the hand with a steak knife.\\\\nThat same evening, Meacham dies of a heart attack while drinking in his home. George begins to focus on Kathryn after finding a ticket to a movie theatre in her dresser waste basket, and she denies having seen the film. He tricks her into giving him access to her office, logs into her computer and learns that she will be traveling to Zurich. He persuades Clarissa to redirect a spy satellite and watches Kathryn meet with an expatriate Russian operative in Switzerland. Later, James informs George that Kathryn has access to a Zurich bank account containing \\u00a37 million in misdirected and unexplained funds. In a psychiatric session, Zoe asks if Kathryn prioritizes her career or her husband. In a subsequent session, Zoe breaks up with James.\\\\nIt is revealed that during the few minutes George redirected the satellite to watch Kathryn's meeting in Zurich, another expat Russian operative disappeared from a Liechtenstein safehouse with a copy of the Severus program, and he is now en route to Eastern Europe to use it to cause a nuclear meltdown. Clarissa tells Freddie, with whom she has reconciled, about her involvement, and Freddie secretly warns Kathryn that George suspects her. In bed that night, the couple compare notes and realize they are being set up. Kathryn uses Clarissa to track the Russian. She suspects that their boss, Stieglitz, deliberately leaked Severus to cause a nuclear meltdown and destabilize the Russian government even though it would kill thousands of innocent people. She leaks the expat Russians' location to a CIA contact, resulting in a drone strike that kills them as they travel through Poland. George subjects all suspects except Kathryn to a polygraph test to determine who might be behind the leak.\\\\nThey invite the other four suspects to a second dinner party. Instead of serving dinner, Kathryn places a gun on the table while George announces they will play a game in which he asks each of them a single question. His questions reveal several secrets, including that Freddie and Zoe had an affair, and that Zoe learned of the Severus program from James and attempted to stop its dissemination due to her Catholic faith. George states that there were two plots: one by Stieglitz and James to leak Severus and cause a nuclear meltdown, and another by Zoe and Freddie to use Kathryn to stop it. James grabs the gun, confesses to plotting with Stieglitz and killing Meacham, and fires at George twice. However, the gun was loaded with blanks. Kathryn pulls a gun from her bag and kills James, after which she firmly warns the remaining colleagues to never exploit her and George's mutual fidelity again. George dumps James's body in the fishing pond. Kathryn informs Stieglitz that his plot failed and suggests he remove himself from his position. She and George reaffirm their love for each other. At Kathryn's questioning, George reveals that the Zurich bank account containing \\u00a37 million is still untouched.\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.6, "reason": "The actual output correctly states that Black Bag is not a horror film but provides incorrect details about it being a 1994-1995 British TV series.

It was considered a trendsetting film at the time of its release and became one of the year's biggest box-office hits. The film follows a middle-aged man who becomes infatuated with a young woman whom he has never met, leading to a comic chase and an encounter in Mexico.\\\\n\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"plot\\\": \\\"During a surprise 42nd birthday party for the wealthy and famous composer George Webber thrown by his actress girlfriend Samantha Taylor, George finds that he is coping badly with his age. From his car, George glimpses a bride on her way to be married and is instantly obsessed with her beauty. Following her to the church, he crashes into a police cruiser, is stung by a bee and nearly disrupts the wedding ceremony.\\\\nLater that night, Sam and George argue over his treatment of women and his habit of spying on the intimate acts of a neighbor with his consent.\\\\nGeorge visits the minister who performed the wedding and learns that the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist. The following day, while spying on his neighbor, George hits himself with the telescope and falls down an embankment, causing him to miss Sam's phone call. Still obsessed with Jenny, he schedules a dental appointment with her father and learns that Jenny and her husband David have gone to Mexico for their honeymoon. The effects of a comically implausible amount of treatment accompanied by a heavy dose of novocaine, aggravated by immediate heavy drinking, leave George completely incoherent. Sam finally reaches him on the phone, but mistakes him for an intruder and calls the police, who hold George at gunpoint while trying to understand his gibberish. George visits his neighbor's house to take part in an ongoing orgy, but Sam spots him through his telescope, widening the rift between them.\\\\nGeorge impulsively boards a plane to follow the newlyweds to their exclusive resort in Mexico. In the bar, George encounters old acquaintance Mary Lewis, who lacks self-confidence. When they attempt a fling, Mary interprets George's inadequacy in bed as confirmation of her own insecurities.\\\\nAt the beach, George sees Jenny in a swimsuit and is awestruck again by her beauty. Noticing that her husband has fallen asleep on a surfboard, George rents a catamaran and rescues David, making him a hero. Sam sees George on a TV newscast and tries to contact him unsuccessfully. David is hospitalized with sunburn, allowing Jenny and George to spend time alone together. Jenny smokes marijuana and seduces George, but he is horrified when Jenny takes a call from David and casually informs him of George's presence. George is even more confused with David's complete lack of concern. Jenny explains she is in an open marriage and married David only because of pressure from her conservative father. George leaves after realizing that Jenny sees their tryst as nothing more than a casual fling.\\\\nAfter flying home, George reconciles with Sam by performing an apologetic new song and demonstrating greater maturity. He suggests getting married, but they agree they should first work on arguing less and making love more. George takes an idea from Jenny when he starts Bol\\u00e9ro on his phonograph and he makes love with Sam in full view of the neighbor's telescope, though the neighbor has already stopped watching out of frustration that he provides erotic entertainment for George and gets nothing in return.\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8, "reason": "The actual output lists 10 movies with directors but omits specific ranking sources like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes mentioned in the expected output.
