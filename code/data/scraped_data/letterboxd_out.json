            "oh. what do you do when one day you wake up and look at your life and realize this was never the life you were supposed to have? and you realize that the man who loves you isn't someone you can respect, and the one man you respect isn't someone you can forgive? (do you choose your home or your mirror?)\u00a0worse, how do you confess that you'd trade your husband and the daughter you made together in a heartbeat for\u2026",

            "broke up with my girlfriend the second the credits rolledi can never be two twinks for her.",
            "There is no sport more intimate or erotic than tennis. It is one of the few major sports where two players agree to partake, for hours, in a duel of body, mind, and soul. Naturally, to engage with anyone that intensely, an inescapable relationship is forged\u2014 one that intensifies with every stroke, every bead of sweat, every grunt. It may not be as fleshy as boxing, but arguably the lack of contact is what makes tennis more arousing\u2014 is not\u2026",
            "Does for tennis what Whiplash did for jazz. Except slightly more horny. Masterpiece.",

            "ALRIGHT BRUH IM FUCKING HORNYJesus fucking lord how do you even make a movie like this HOW HOW HOW. Its so fucking hot and cool and fucking entrancing and INTIMIDATINGThis is only the second movie I\u2019ve seen with Josh O\u2019Connor and I can genuinely say this man is in my top 10 favorite actors of all time. The charm this man exudes is so palpable I wanted to fuck him myself\u00a0Zendaya and Mike Faist absolutely KILLED itLuca you god damn mad man I\u2019m obsessed with you\u00a0AND THAT SOUNDTRACK COME ONNNNNNNNNNNN",
            "No because that fucking score??? I need it playing in my head 24/7!",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve missed playing with you.\u201dChallengers is centered around tennis, yes, but it\u2019s also centered around the \u2018the kiss\u2019. It\u2019s a selling point of the film and gets significant reactions at every screening. Interestingly, while technically new, a premise like this is still something more at home in the 2000s/2010s. Think about your Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or some other outrageous comedy you remember because of one shining set piece.\u00a0Art and Patrick\u2019s friendship/relationship/whatever is textually platonic. Their dialogue\u2026",

            "Been sitting on this one for a bit of time and I just can't come to terms with my feelings. I really want(ed) to like this given how highly rated it is among my mutuals and good friends. I found most of this to be really corny and predictable, which made for an experience devoid of any real tension and urgency. It fell miserably flat for me and none of the pieces came together to create something worthwhile. I rolled\u2026",

            "i love the symmetry. i love the contrast in pace. i love that every interaction has the tension of an elastic band stretching out and snapping back into place. the camera cuts between the three of them in whatever configuration, but it\u2019s only inevitable that they\u2019ll soon occupy the same frame.",

            "If, as Blanche Dubois once said, \u201cThe opposite of death is desire,\u201d then Luca Guadagnino will live forever, and his latest film \u2014 a transcendently sweaty tennis love triangle so turned on by the heat of competition that its sex scenes feel like foreplay and its rallies feel like porn \u2014 is possibly the most unbridled portrait of resurrection since \u201cThe Passion of the Christ.\u201d It\u2019s definitely the horniest story ever set within the purgatorial concrete nothing of New Rochelle,\u2026",
            "prayers up for my boy Tom Holland \ud83d\ude4f",

            "was so amped after watching this i ended up going out til 5am with Harrison and then was super hungover for the met. worth it though.",
            "whiplash (2014) for guys who regret opening up their relationship. kissing is the greatest thing in the world, we were put on this earth to kiss. i flinched every time a tennis ball whizzed past the camera. why\u2019d they use the take of that line about killing yourself \u2018cause you\u2019re 31 where she perfectly enunciated the name \u201cdemi adejuyigbe\u201d",
            "Something shifted in that cinema. Forgive me for the person I became. Those thoughts weren\u2019t me. Blame the churros, blame the love triangle but don\u2019t blame me.",
            "un-fucking-real.everything i complain about in contemporary cinema is gone here: no standardized coverage, every single shot is considered and measured and loosed on the viewer like a thousand thunderbolts --o'connor, faist and zendaya are basically the only three actors in the whole film, it's incredibly focused and intimate drama, not an inch of writerly bloat, and these three have all the chops they need to deliver on what's been required of them -- the score by trent reznor is\u2026",
            "came home to my houseguest watching this for the first time and sat my ass down for the remainder. truly a shame this isn\u2019t message-driven enough to get love at the Oscars (I\u2019m predicting best original screenplay and best score noms, maybe) because i do think this is one of the best films ever made about sex and power and attraction. love how each character gets a section to be the villain until they all feel equally villainous (and therefore,\u2026",
            "it\u2019s like twilight but with less vampires, less werewolves, more tennis, and more dudes kissing",
            "Really dug this. Luca Guadagnino's film uses tennis as an extension of its characters, and the result is an electric collision of will, ambition, friendship, lust, passion, resentment, and love. The love story at the heart of it might not be the one you expect. The kinetic filmmaking and Justin Kuritzkes's razor sharp script are helped by committed performances and an all-timer of a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.",
            "luca guadagnino surprises me from the usual footsteps i know from his work. from his former work of intimate, sometimes even drawn out, scenes, im met in challengers with a dance through every scene matched to a tennis like rhythm.\u00a0these three mains couldn\u2019t have been casted better. mike plays into such a boy next door trope that works perfectly and is matched with joshes shit eating grin at every corner. but me oh my is this a turning point\u2026",
            "she just wanted to watch some good tennis and i just wanted to watch some good cinema.\u00a0we both got what we wanted. thank you luca once again",
            "Edging: the movie.Everything about this pulsing, throbbing thriller is lava hot. It asks the philosophical question, \u201cDoes tennis\u2026make me horny?\u201d It\u2019s fitting that it explores themes of passion and obsession because everyone will be passionately obsessed with this movie.\u00a0Reznor and Ross do it again, btw, the score is insane.",
            "two bros, sweaty in the sauna, five feet apart cause they're not gay",
            "guys ? haha? did we watch the same film??\u00a0long form review because i think i need to rant!\u00a0the beginning was set up extremely well and i was so interested - like hello i LOVE a good party scene! but then it just went down hill from thereokay, all the acting was good and everyone gave a good performance i am more than happy to admit this but my major problem is with the sound editing and editing\u2026",
            "as usual this all could've been avoided with some gay love &amp; sex"
