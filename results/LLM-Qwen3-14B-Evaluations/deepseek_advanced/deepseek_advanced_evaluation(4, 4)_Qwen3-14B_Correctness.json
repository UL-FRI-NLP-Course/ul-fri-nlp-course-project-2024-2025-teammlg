Additionally, the expected output discusses 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) and 'Doctor Strange' (2016), which are unrelated to the actual output's content about post-'Endgame' movies. The actual output contains multiple contradictions and irrelevant information compared to the expected output's specific details about the timeline and film details following 'Civil War'."
