Without relevant nodes in the retrieval context, there is no basis for the contextual recall, leading to a perfect score of zero. This situation highlights the necessity of having pertinent information in the retrieval context to enable accurate attribution of statements from the expected output, which was not present in this case, resulting in the lowest possible score of 0.00. However, it's important to note that this outcome is not a reflection of the quality of the expected output but rather an indication of the absence of necessary information in the retrieval context to support the contextual recall process. In such scenarios, the contextual recall score is inevitably zero, as there are no nodes in the retrieval context to which any part of the expected output can be linked, thus rendering the score as 0.00. This situation underscores the critical role that a well-populated retrieval context plays in achieving a higher contextual recall score, as demonstrated by the lack of nodes in this instance leading to the lowest possible score of 0.00. However, it's essential to understand that the score of 0.00 is not an indication of the expected output's accuracy or completeness but rather a direct consequence of the retrieval context being devoid of any relevant information that could support the statements made in the expected output.
