            "summary": "Drive is a 2011 American action drama film directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. The screenplay, written by Hossein Amini, is based on James Sallis's 2005 novel. The film stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. He quickly grows fond of his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, Benicio. When her debt-ridden husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison, the two men take part in what turns out to be a failed million-dollar heist that endangers the lives of everyone involved. The film co-stars Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman, and Albert Brooks.\nProducers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel optioned the source novel after Siegel read a review from Publishers Weekly. Adapting the book proved to be challenging for Amini, as it had a nonlinear narrative. Gosling, one of Platt's top casting choices, eventually signed on for the lead, as he wanted to star in an action-oriented project. Gosling played a pivotal role in the film's production, which included hiring Refn as director and Beth Mickle as production designer. Newton Thomas Sigel oversaw the principal photography, which started on September 25, 2010, was shot on location in Los Angeles, and ended on November 12.\nBefore its September 2011 release, Drive had been shown at film festivals, including the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation. Refn won the festival's Best Director Award. The film was praised for its direction, cinematography, performances (particularly Gosling and Brooks'), visuals, action sequences, and musical score; however, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found it to be potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Nonetheless, the film was still a commercial success, grossing over $81 million against a production budget of $15 million. Several critics listed Drive as one of the best films of 2011, including the National Board of Review. Its honors include a nomination for Best Sound Editing at the 84th Academy Awards. The film has garnered a cult following since release.\n\n",
            "plot": "A man in Los Angeles (billed as \"The Driver\") works as a mechanic, stunt double, and criminal-for-hire getaway driver. His jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades Jewish-American mobster Bernie Rose and his half-Italian partner Nino \"Izzy\" Paolozzi to purchase a stock car for the Driver to race as a legitimate business for them all.\nThe Driver grows close to his new neighbor, Irene, and her young son, Benicio, but their relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison. Standard owes protection money and is assaulted by Albanian gangster Chris Cook, who demands that he rob a pawn shop for $40,000 to pay off the debt. Cook threatens Benicio and Irene, leading the Driver to offer to act as the getaway driver for Standard and Blanche, Cook's accomplice.\nAt the pawn shop, Blanche exits with a bag of money, but Standard is shot and killed by the store owner. Pursued by another car, the Driver and Blanche hide at a motel, where he forces her to admit that the bag contains $1 million, which she and Cook planned to take for themselves with Cook's henchmen in the other car. Ambushed by the henchmen, Blanche is shot in the head. The Driver kills both gunmen.\nShannon offers to hide the money, but the Driver declines. He tracks Cook to a strip club and forces him to reveal that Nino was behind the robbery. The Driver calls Nino, who dismisses an offer to return the money and be left alone. Nino instead sends a hitman to the Driver and Irene's apartment building. The Driver tells an angry Irene about his involvement with her husband's death, and they enter the elevator, not realizing the assassin is in it. Noticing the man's gun, the Driver kisses Irene before brutally stomping the assassin to death.  Irene is horrified.\nThe Driver confronts Shannon, who reveals that he called Bernie about the money and unwittingly mentioned Irene. Furious, the Driver tells Shannon to flee, as Nino will surely hunt them both. Nino reveals to Bernie that a low-level Philadelphia mobster stashed the money at the pawn shop to set up a new operation. Anyone tied to the robbery must be killed, as they could lead the East Coast mob to Nino and Bernie.\nBernie murders Cook. When Shannon refuses to divulge the Driver's whereabouts, he fatally slashes Shannon's forearm with a straight razor. The Driver discovers Shannon's corpse at the auto shop. He disguises himself with a rubber stuntman's mask and follows Nino from the pizzeria to the Pacific Coast Highway. He rams Nino's car onto a beach, then drowns him in the ocean. He calls Irene and tells her that he will not return, explaining that she and Benicio were the best part of his life.\nThe Driver meets with Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. At the Driver's car, Bernie stabs him in the stomach, but he stabs Bernie to death and manages to drive away, leaving Bernie's corpse and the money behind. Irene knocks on the Driver's apartment door and walks away when no one answers. Severely wounded, the Driver drives into the night."
