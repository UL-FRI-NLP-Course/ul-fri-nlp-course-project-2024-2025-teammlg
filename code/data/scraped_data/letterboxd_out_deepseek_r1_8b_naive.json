It‚Äôs a rare blend: one that manages to successfully mix Hong Kong action sensibilities, interesting characters, enough of a story so that its easy to follow but still not entirely vapid, funny dialogue, explosions and more spinning flipping kicks then I ever think I‚Äôve seen in a two-hour time period before.

                "75A US martial arts film with buddy comedy structure and Hong Kong action sensibilities. Very funny, with Brittany Murphy lighting up the screen in a supporting role, and featuring wall-to-wall mayhem. The climax is set in a space-tech-noir themed restaurant/bar, with bad guys on BMX bikes and plenty of hyper-kinetic choreography. It's absurdly well-made and so fucking fun. This late-90s gem is sorely underseen for such a memorable action film of its day.",
